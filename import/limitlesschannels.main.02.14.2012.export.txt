BODY:
Been doing some research on tea lately.  This is a super-basic breakdown to help someone from being totally overwhelmed with a tea menu.  Here's a quick list of the different types, caffeine content, etc.  There are 2 real types of Tea; those from the Camellia Sinensis plant and "Herbal."  Camellia Sinensis is the real tea-tree type, while herbal is the catch all for everything we've come to associate with tea, but really is just a bunch of herbs to be drunk together.  Remind me to throw together a post on folk taxonomies in the future to go further into this catch-all business.<br/><br/><em>Quick brewing note:  Excessively hot water causes release of tannin, i.e. you'll be drinking bitter tea.  Water should not be boiling when added, but just under.  Steeping time should be around 3o seconds to 3 minutes.</em><br/><h3>Camellia Sinensis</h3><br/><h4>Green Tea</h4><br/>Green tea is as basic as you can get, widespread usage originated from China but has since spread to being grown all throughout Asia and throughout the world.  Green tea is straight off the plant, <strong>unoxidized </strong>and dried with minimal processing.<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Caffeine: 20mg (range :15-30)</li><br/></ul><br/><h4>White Tea</h4><br/>White tea is a somewhat younger version of green tea.  White tea is picked before the buds have fully flowered (i.e. have little white hairs still on them, hence the name).  The <strong>least caffeinated</strong> of any natural tea, due to its young age.  Also <strong>unoxidized with minimal processing.</strong><br/><ul><br/>	<li>Caffeine: 15mg (range: 6-25)</li><br/></ul><br/><h4>Black Tea</h4><br/>Black tea is <strong>fully oxidized, giving it a stronger flavor and more caffeine</strong>.  The process grants black tea a longer shelf-life, so it could originally be transported to Europe and survive the trip from Asia with more flavor and plenty of caffeine.  Still made with Camellia Sinensis but occasionally leaves from the Assamese variety.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><br/><h4>Caffeine: 40mg (range: 40-60)</h4><br/></li><br/></ul><br/><h4>Oolong Tea</h4><br/>Oolong tea is traditionally a Chinese tea, partially oxidized and therefore halfway between a green and a black.  <strong>Oxidation is between 10 to 70%</strong>.  This is the most popular tea served in Chinese restaurants.<br/><h3>Herbal</h3><br/>There are way, way too many varieties to list here since this is basically a made-up category but I'll cover just two of the most popular.<br/><h4>Yerba Mate</h4><br/>Mate is made from the Ilex Paraguarensis plant.  It is harvested heavily throughout South America and extremely popular throughout Argentina and Brazil.  Usually drunk out of a gourd, some like to add some lemon to it, where it earned the nickname "terere" [TEH-REH-RAY, trilling each "R"].  Mate has been believed to have a chemical called Mateine in it, as an alternative to caffeine but recent research and really shown the two to be more or less synonymous.<br/><h4>Rooibos Tea</h4><br/>Rooibos Tea (aka "Red Tea") is made from Aspalathus Linearis, a red bush plant popular in South Africa.  The plant has a <strong>low tannin</strong> concentration and <strong>no caffeine</strong>, making it a nice alternative to teas of the Camellia family.

BODY:
I attended the "Pandora Town Hall" meeting tonight where Tim (founder of Pandora.com) spoke at Weiden+Kennedy advertising firm.  The talk was an illuminating look into the history of the company, its founding and inevitable financial issues, and most interestingly the Music Genome Project powering the site.  The meet-ups are apparently something Tim has been doing since the founding of the site in 2005 where he travels around to get real input from the genuine site users.<br/><br/>The idea of Pandora came about sometime around January of 2000 and finally solidified into the free service Pandora.com in November of 2005.  Before that the site was a subscription service with the first 10 hours free then a $3 a month credit card fee.<br/><br/>Apparently the site designer used to work at a children's museum, hence the simplicity of design.<br/><br/>As Tim says "thumbing is kind of an art."  and users LOVE to thumb.  Some 2 billion thumbs were processed in 2010 alone.<br/><br/><strong>How about that Music Genome Project? </strong><br/><br/>400 genes make up the genome for song sequencing by Pandora's analysts.  Pandora employs some 25 musicians who simply sit and listen to music all day scoring songs on headphones.  Every single song (about 80,000 within the system now) is done manually, since computers cannot do the quality job a true human can.  A 4-minute pop song takes about 15 minutes to map, and a symphony can take an hour and a half.  The team seems to map out about 10,000 songs a month this way.<br/><br/>Tempo is the most defining feature of the genome map.<br/><br/>Analysts must go through 100 hours of training before they can map pop/rock songs.  After that, there is another test and tier for jazz mapping, and then even a third for the elusive classical music mappers.<br/><br/>Only 10% of songs need to be mapped twice.  If need be, with additional mapping over 90% are within a couple points of each other.<br/><br/><strong>How are which songs to be added chosen?</strong> Every missed search is tracked data to give the analysts heads-up on what music to add next.<br/><br/><strong>Metadata?</strong> The only metadata used in mapping is year song was released.  The Pandora team is actually pretty damn religious about user privacy and stores next to nothing on user-identifiable data.<br/><br/><strong>What about artist royalties?</strong><br/><br/>Artists are paid 2 cents an hour (which seriously adds up given the amount of music constantly streaming (that's some 65 million users in the U.S. alone).  Pandora pulled in $500 million revenue last year with 60% paid to artists as performance and publishing fees.<br/><br/><strong>Tips:</strong><br/><br/>If you like a certain band with a long, varying career and only really like one genre of their stuff, Tim recommended launching the station by a specific song, rather than the artist.  Due to the intricacies of the genome, it will give you a more accurate reading by the style of the song over the artist.<br/><br/>Bookmarking and Skipping are neutral features on Pandora that do not affect likes/dislikes.<br/><br/>Songs are played in 3 or 4 song sets, if you're curious about stylization patterns.

BODY:
<p>Garden Path Sentences are some of the more interesting cognitive linguistic tools that give us some clever insight into how our minds process syntax. &nbsp;A Garden Path sentence involves an initial (incorrect) reading of the phrase and a subsequent rereading for the correct meaning. &nbsp;The basic idea is that we process sentences on the fly and bi-directionally. &nbsp;Without delving too deeply into models of visual word processing and how we read, there are several fascinating insights into the way this works, but for brevity sake I'll just give some examples. &nbsp;The sentences are first read through sequentially from left to right but upon reaching the end of the phrase in confusion, the eyes of the reader will jump back and forth in a reinterpretation of the sentence to find the true meaning.</p>
<p>Before reading the intepretations try and figure out the meaning of the sentences yourself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;"The old man the boat."&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Intepretation One: <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The old man]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [the boat]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span></em>." two sequential noun phrases (NPs) with no perceivable verb.</span></p>
<p>Interpretation Two (post restructuring): <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The old]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span>&nbsp;[man]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">VERB</span>&nbsp;[the boat]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP.</span></em>" &nbsp;After the first reading "man" is revealed to be the verb, not part of the subject noun phrase.</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">Or my favorite and perhaps the best well-known:</p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;"The horse raced past the barn fell"</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation One: <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The horse]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [raced]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">V</span> [past]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">AD</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">V</span> [the barn]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span>&nbsp;[fell]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">???</span>.</em>" Here the reader will first read it as a complete sentence with a stranded verb "fell."</span></p>
<p>Interpretation Two (post restructuring): <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The horse raced past the barn]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [fell]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">VERB</span>.</em>" Where everything but the verb "fell" is part of the subject noun phrase. &nbsp;In this case the horse <strong>is being raced</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, while both are correct a clarification for the sentences ambiguity could be rephrasing the sentence as "The horse <strong>that was </strong>raced past the barn fell"</p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">Here's a short Youtube video demonstrating saccades in reading:</p>

<p>Short excerpt from the absurd piece filed under "Cat" for the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, back in 1768 when it was a mere three volumes with three contributors:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Of all domestic animals, the character of the cat is the most equivocal and suspicious. &nbsp;He is kept, not for any amiable qualities, but purely with a view to banish rats, mice and other noxious animals from our houses... Constantly bent upon theft and rapine, they are full of cunning and dissimulation; they conceal all their designs; seize every opportunity of doing mischief, and then fly from punishment... In a word, the cat is totally destitute of friendship.</em></p>
<p>Furthermore, they are considered "overly amorous" (i.e. horny) and while pretending to sleep "in reality they are meditating mischief."</p>

<p>Google Research blog (which until this post I never knew actually existed) just posted some cool data (with chart porn!) on cross-language linkage throughout the web. &nbsp;High linguistic correlations between certain languages across sites mirrors a surprisingly similar geographic distributions, which depending on who you are may or may not have been obvious (I'm undecided myself).</p>
<p>Disregarding the world language of English the languages appear to link across such alliances as former soviet republics and &nbsp;the data even demonstrate geographic isolationist and introverted cultures such as the surprisingly large lack of English among Chinese and Japanese sites.</p>

DATE: 07/09/2011 07:46:38 PM

BODY:
<p>I found in the archives of&nbsp;<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Lousy Linguistic</a> blog <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/01/why-linguists-should-study-math.html" target="_blank">a great post on the importance of studying mathematics, </a>specifically logic and statistics, in linguistics. &nbsp;With the recent rise in popularity in such fields as psycholinguistics or Natural Language Processing it has indeed become increasingly important but even such basics as transformational grammar and semantic analysis have been enhanced through mathematical thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Linguists should study math* because</strong>...</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a name="more"></a></em></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li><em>Math is a tool that helps you.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>It's not that hard.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Math is good training for the mind.</em></li>
<li><em>Math is the future.</em></li>
<li><em>You will be left behind without it.</em></li>
<li><em>You will be a better linguist.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An important caveat and one of Chris' excellent points in the post is the importance but not over-importance of utilizing mathematical analysis within linguistics. &nbsp;Yes, it is extremely helpful and important for all the listed reasons but the goal is linguistic analysis-- not mathematical-- and to rely too heavily on math will lead to inaccurate and bad language work.</p>
<p>Why? &nbsp;Because language is based on human thought and as humans we are not rational creatures. &nbsp;We try to be, and it is a worthy pursuit, but at best one is imposing a rational framework on an irrational system.</p>
<p>Actually, in an older separate post he writes on this very point, although in a somewhat different context on his <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2007/12/linguists-vs-economists.html">Linguists versus Economists</a> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Part of the difference is probably due to the fact that economists work under the assumption that economic decisions are conscious and rational while linguists work under the assumption that linguistic decisions are automatic or unconscious</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So.. mathematics, good, but handle with care or you could be one of those <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/651912.html">anthropologists</a>/biologists/mathematicians/game theorists who pop up every other week with a new "I just spent 10 minutes figuring out how language works" theory. &nbsp;<a href="http://xkcd.com/793/" target="_blank">Relevant</a>.</p>

<p>"By plotting the distributions of words used in financial articles published online between 2006 and 2010 into a computer model, we were able to identify what we call 'verb convergence' and 'noun convergence &mdash; where the language used by financial journalists shows converging agreement. Our study shows that reporters converge on the same language &mdash; 'stocks rose again', 'scaled new heights', or 'soared' &mdash; as their commentaries became more uniformly positive in the lead up to the 2007 crash. They also appear to refer to a smaller-than-usual set of market events &mdash; presumably because of an increased fixation on a small number of rapidly rising stocks."</p>

<p>Thanks to the excellent story-telling podcast <a class="offsite-link-inline" title="The Moth weekly Podcast" href="http://themoth.org/" target="_blank">The Moth</a> I was recently reintroduced to one of the seven deadly sins in a way I've never seen or heard previously. &nbsp;One of the less interesting and thus less explored sins is that of Sloth, often translated today as utter laziness. &nbsp;This modern definition however varies quite a bit from the original idea, known as 'Acedia.' &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia">Acedia </a>actually refers to something more along the line of apathy or depression. &nbsp;Thomas Aquinas even had some interesting things to write on that end.</p>
<p>I actually stumbled upon something along a similar vein a while back when I was researching the "unforgivable sin<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">s</span></strong>" in the Catholic tradition. &nbsp;For a quick aside I was always curious what that elusive plural included, other than suicide, and after some research concluded that apparently blasphemy against the Holy spirit is one of the only other unforgivable sins, really. &nbsp;Not Jesus, apparently, that's fine, but don't talk about the goddamn holy spirit!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and blasphemy. But the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the&nbsp;Son of Man&nbsp;will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the&nbsp;age to come.</em>&rdquo;</p>

This creed is extremely simply: here it is. I believe that there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, more rational, more manly and more perfect than the Saviour: <em>I say to myself with jealous love that not only is there no one else like Him, but that there could be no one.&rdquo; I confess that one of my coping mechanisms for my depression is that thought &ldquo;One sees the truth more clearly when one is unhappy.&rdquo;</em></em></p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This is one of my linguistics-heavy posts so unless you are of that prediliction or just genuinely interesting in identifying word stress, go ahead and move on.</em></p>
<p>Started a thread on Reddit asking about identifying stress, here's some of the better responses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trick that I always learned to identify stress was to pronounce the word with incorrect stress. I'm going to avoid using IPA for my example to better illustrate (with caps) what I mean. For "delayed" (assuming my dialectical pronunciation, of course): DEE-laid or dih-LAID.</p>
<p>These are the two options for stress, either on the first syllable or the second. For me, the first one sounds like a rapper's name D-laid (lol), whereas the second sounds natural. De<em>layed</em>.</p>
<p>The best option when transcribing, however, is to listen to the other para-linguistic attributes of the speech (dynamics, duration of syllable, pitch, vocalic clarity, etc). A vocalic shift often occurs with a shift of stress (ref. PREsent, the gift and preSENT, to display). Some languages have strict rules on where the stress should occur, so that can sometimes help be a guide in determining its location. Finally, keep in mind that stress can also be altered to determine emphasis or can be affected by pauses in speech, so if you can identify those secondary causes, it might help you in figuring out the exact location of the stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and another one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you're trying to figure out the stress of just a single word, try saying the word naturally, like you would in a sentence or normal discourse. If you enunciate all the syllables in the word, then of course that makes it more difficult. English has vowel reduction--i.e. on unstressed syllables, the vowel tends to get reduced to a schwa. So <strong>listen for schwas, that'll indicate it's an unstressed syllable</strong>. In my dialect, I would&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;say [di.lejd] (unless I'm really enunciating), but rather [də.lejd]. So the stress is on the second syllable the way I say it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stressed syllables are also longer in duration and louder.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and another one, perhaps the simplest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try humming, marching or clapping your hands as you pronounce the words. You can also say them very loud.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191771234">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Thorough and encompassing summary of the language issues involved in one of the most interesting language reforms in history.  One issue I found was the nostalgic tinge Lewis takes on near the end when he begins to lament to the "better times" and loss of certain features; a perspective I'd consider a bit short-sighted for someone woh studies language change at all.  Some basic understanding of Turkish (and Arabic, as well) would be preferable when approaching this book but is entirely unnecessary.

BODY:
<p>So I've decided to start getting more serious and frequent on this blog. &nbsp;I'll be trying a daily blogging experiment today that I'll be extending for the next two months, or as far as I can actually keep this up. &nbsp;We'll see.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, today is the second day of my two month nootropics/cognitive-training regiment. &nbsp;I've had an interest in smart drugs (often called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropics" target="_blank">nootropics</a>) for quite some time now and while I've played with them in the past, any experiments I've done have lacked in some serious scientific rigor. &nbsp;So, starting yesterday I've mapped out the next two months with twice daily doses of nootropics, once a day general vitamins, and some nice spreadsheet-directed cataloguing. &nbsp;I should be posting some kind of updates in the next few weeks but if not I'll definitely have some nice data by the end of my session to post.</p>
<p>Each day I'll be cataloguing sleep, mood, energy, and exercise on a scale of 0 to 5 as well as participating in 20 daily <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">N-Back</a> sessions and using my long-time friend <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://ichi2.net/anki" target="_blank">Anki</a> for spaced-repetition memory testing. &nbsp;N-Back research has pointed to near linear improvement so significant improvement via the noots should increase the slope by N factors, whatever that may be. &nbsp;Color me hopeful but skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>Daily:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Multivitamin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B Complex</p>
</li>
<li>DHA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twice daily:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Piracetam 800mg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choline 500mg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vinpocetine 10mg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Huperzine 200mcg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DMAE (and later) ALCAR</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information on any of the above can be found below, or go ahead and email/tweet me:</p>
<p><a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ" target="_blank">Excellent lengthy N-Back information page</a></p>
<p>Regarding Anki, more information can be found on their site or on Wikipedia's <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition article</a>&nbsp;and on <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php" target="_blank">Omniglot's site</a> which has a nice collection of the different available types.</p>
<p>Legit information on nootropics is widespread and hard to coalesce but <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/" target="_blank">here's a fairly anecdotal and well-cited forum post</a> that is honestly one of the better collected information sources I've found. &nbsp;Otherwise, feel free to pick up the classic (and again rather outdated) text <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Drugs-Nutrients-Intelligence-Neuroscience/dp/0941683249/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312331116&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank">Smart Drugs by Ward Dean</a>.</p>

<p>Found this post to be pretty inspiring, mostly cause it seems to be a nice MED for cognitive enhancement. Will you be putting up more info on how it ended up? I got the Ngyuen N-Back app and it is quite nice. Is there any way to get a copy of  the blank spreadsheet you used how you tracked everything? Thank you!</p>

<p><em><strong>"Omensetters Luck"</strong>&nbsp;by William H. Gass (1966)&nbsp;<br />Gass' first novel, and his least avant-gardeish, and his best. Basically a religious book. Very sad. Contains the immortal line "The body of Our Saviour shat but Our Saviour shat not." Bleak but gorgeous, like light through ice.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>"Steps"</strong>&nbsp;by Jerzy Kosinski (1968)<br />This won some big prize or other when it first came out, but today nobody seems to remember it. "Steps" gets called a novel but it is really a collection of unbelievably creepy little allegorical tableaux done in a terse elegant voice that's like nothing else anywhere ever. Only Kafka's fragments get anywhere close to where Kosinski goes in this book, which is better than everything else he ever did combined.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>"Angels"</strong>&nbsp;by Denis Johnson (1983)<br />This was Johnson's first fiction after the horripilative lyric poetry of "Incognito Lounge." Even cult fans of "Jesus' Son" often haven't heard of "Angels." It's sort of "Jesus' Son's" counterpoint, a novel-length odyssey of mopes and scrotes and their brutal redemptions. A totally&nbsp;American&nbsp;book, it's also got great prose, truly great, some of the '80s' best; e.g. lines like "All around them men drank alone, staring out of their faces."</em></p>
<p><em><strong>"Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West"</strong>&nbsp;by Cormac McCarthy (1985)<br />Dont even ask.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>"Wittgenstein's Mistress"</strong>&nbsp;by David Markson (1988)<br />"W's M" is a dramatic rendering of what it would be like to live in the sort of universe described by logical atomism. A monologue, formally very odd, mostly one-sentence 6s. Tied with "Omensetter's Luck" for the all-time best U.S. book about human loneliness. These wouldnt constitute ringing endorsements if they didnt happen all to be simultaneously true -- i.e., that a novel this abstract and erudite and avant-garde that could also be so moving makes "Wittgenstein's Mistress" pretty much the high point of experimental fiction in this country.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-size: 90%;">My previous article describes N-Back a bit better for those who missed it or are interested: <a href="http://bit.ly/r6g9r7" target="_blank">What Exactly is N-Back?</a></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bit of Background</strong>: Now that I've finally started putting in daily N-Back sessions and just like the rest of my life, I've been slowly converting everything to mobile so I can handle all my tasks away from a computer. &nbsp;Best case scenario I find a universally-compatible program with a desktop and mobile component. &nbsp;While that part is still severely lacking (nothing here has a desktop equivalent) there are some rough hacks involving dropbox that I have been working on. &nbsp;Until I perfect that script anyway, I will stick entirely to my Android phone. &nbsp;Which app is the best? &nbsp;Well as of August 10th, I've tried all the dedicated ones and even the paid ones. So, on to the comparison.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are currently&nbsp;6 main candidates in the app market: Quazar's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=quazar.BrainNBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Brain N Back</a>, Nguyen's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnback&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Brain N-Back</a>, Polytech's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.Projet4A.DualNBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">DualNBack</a>, and Piotr's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=cz.wie.p.nback&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">N-Back</a>. &nbsp;Given the complete lack of creative naming this review might get absurdly confusing, so I'll try and use the author's name for these.&nbsp; Oh, also there is <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=waterdev.NBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Waterdev's NBack</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=appinventor.ai_viana_octavio.IQ_Boost_free&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">IQBoost</a>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but since I'm a cheap bastard right now, I haven't quite gone out and bought this these</span> since I wasn't super satisfied with all the other offerings, I decided to try out these two, as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>A note on feedback: I think the feedback feature can be detrimental to the exercise since it is too easy to get caught up mid-task and analyze one's correct or incorrect move, affecting the spontanaeity and focus of the exercise. &nbsp;Feedback can be useful occasionally for "calibrating" oneself to the new N- turn variable, but otherwise I believe should be avoided, hence I do not tend to mention it as a feature here.</em>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>This one was interesting, given the less then detailed explanation in the market I assumed it to be fairly minimal like Quazar's but Piotr's actually has some of the best settings of any of the apps. &nbsp;In my brief testing it was stable, however the audio was not very clear and the control scheme was a mess on my 4.3" screen. &nbsp;One review said it was designed for the Nexus One (4" screen, so perhaps that is the issue).</p>

<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/storage/n-back-images/IQBoost.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1313006191312" alt="" /></span>&nbsp;+ Variable stimulus; either sound, spatial, or both</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Only single or dual N-back possible</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Unique style. Audio stimulus uses farm animals rather than letters or numbers</p>
<p>&nbsp;+ Allows for variable duration, which may or may not actually be useful</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Statistics?</p>
<p>** Interesting feature note: IQ Boost also comes in a "boys name version" and "girls name version." &nbsp;No idea what that is and there's no description.</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 5 / 10</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Winner:</span></strong></p>
<p>Piotr's NBack clearly has the best feature set and options that I really want in an app, yet awkward layout (at least for my 4.3 screen) and while it has most of what I'm looking for, one other seems to bring it all together in the most packaged and balanced way, so without further ado:</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span><strong>Nguyen's N-Back!</strong></p>
<p>While there are a couple features still lacking, Nguyen's still had the greatest balance of features with the right amount of interface polish. &nbsp;While it still lacks some certain features, Nguyen appears to be a pretty great dev who responds to all requests, so I'll be submitting my desired features and we shall see if we can't make the best on so far a bit better. &nbsp;Meanwhile, if you feel like supporting him, there's a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnbackpremium&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">"premium" ad-free version on the market</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely satisfied with the apps available right now, so until I get a few more features or stability in each, I'll be sticking with Nguyen's.</p>
<p><strong>Things I still want:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exporting</strong> (if any did have this then I would have just posted my own N-Back daily sessions here in some nice data-aggregating fashion)</li>
<li><strong>Better statistics</strong>, that is the ability to review previous days in detail</li>
<li><strong>Session limits for the day</strong>, i.e. stopping at 20 rather than infinite regression</li>
</ul>

EXCERPT:
<p><em style="font-size: 90%;"><span style="font-size: 90%;">My previous article describes N-Back a bit better for those who missed it or are interested: <a href="http://bit.ly/r6g9r7" target="_blank">What Exactly is N-Back?</a></span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now that I've finally started putting in daily N-Back sessions and just like the rest of my life, I've been slowly converting everything to mobile so I can handle all my tasks away from a computer. &nbsp;Best case scenario I find a universally-compatible program with a desktop and mobile component. &nbsp;While that part is still severely lacking (nothing here has a desktop equivalent) there are some rough hacks involving dropbox that I have been working on. &nbsp;Until I perfect that script anyway, I will stick entirely to my Android phone. &nbsp;Which app is the best? &nbsp;Well as of August 10th, I've tried all the dedicated ones and even the paid ones. So, on to the comparison.</p>
<p>There are currently <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">&nbsp;4 </span>&nbsp;6 main candidates in the app market: Quazar's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=quazar.BrainNBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Brain N Back</a>, Nguyen's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnback&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Brain N-Back</a>, Polytech's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.Projet4A.DualNBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">DualNBack</a>, and Piotr's&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=cz.wie.p.nback&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">N-Back</a>. &nbsp;Given the complete lack of creative naming this review might get absurdly confusing, so I'll try and use the author's name for these.&nbsp; Oh, also there is <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=waterdev.NBack&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">Waterdev's NBack</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=appinventor.ai_viana_octavio.IQ_Boost_free&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">IQBoost</a>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but since I'm a cheap bastard right now, I haven't quite gone out and bought this these</span> since I wasn't super satisfied with all the other offerings, I decided to try out these two, as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Born and colleagues (2007) had human subject learn card pair locations while smelling different odors simultaneously (the top left card paired with the scent of my feet, for example). When the researchers reintroduced those same smells during the subjects' slow wave sleep (my feet in the poor subject's face), memory for the card pair locations (top left card) tied to those smells (my feet) were enhanced at recall the next day. Also, through fMRI they saw reactivation of the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.&nbsp;In an alternative study, they used transcranial magnetic stimulation to essentially boost slow oscillations during NREM sleep, which not only increased slow wave sleep and sleep spindles, but also enhanced declarative memory consolidation.&nbsp;<br /><br />From these findings they developed a model postulating that slow waves originating from the neocortex synced both hippocampal sharp waves and thalamocortical sleep spindles, resulting in primed cortical networks for long-term memory storage. <strong>The research team was the first to provide empirical support for a causal role of hippocampal memory reactivation for memory enhancement during sleep.<br /><br />The key point I'm trying to emphasize here is that slow wave sleep and sleep spindle activity are essential for sleep dependent declarative memory consolidation.</strong></p>

<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/session.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1312940352396" alt="" /><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 340px;">via Brainworkshop</span></span></p>
<p>I've talked about N-Back quite a bit here and since it is currently the basis for my two month long cognitive training experiment I figured I should probably explain this a bit. &nbsp;I gave a brief description previously <a href="http://www.limitlesschannels.com/main/2011/8/2/life-update-blog-posts-and-cognitive-enhancement.html" target="_blank">here</a> but it was more of a hand-off to an overly long and detailed post. &nbsp;I will probably be talking about this quite a bit in the future and having been supremely dissatisfied with any online descriptions I've found in the past, I figure I can stick all the info and links in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>N-Back is training strategy for increasing one's fluid intelligence. &nbsp;That's basically it. &nbsp;Fluid intelligence has been shown to tie directly to that outdated but romantic idea of IQ and the gist is: <strong>increase</strong> <strong>fluid intelligence via working memory and get smarter</strong>. &nbsp;While N-Back has been around since 1958, Jaeggi, one of the major researchers today into the subject, published the widely-cited paper in 2008 titled "Improving Fluid Intelligence with Training on Working Memory" (found <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://1.usa.gov/nJwRMa " target="_blank">here</a>) which really started off the wave of testing and N-Back's entrance into popular culture, such as <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/smart_software" target="_blank">this Wired Article</a>. &nbsp;Since then, a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5454984" target="_blank">variety</a> of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610001091" target="_blank">testing</a> has occurred and in terms of cognitive training, N-Back has proved <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://bit.ly/oOT2Ya" target="_blank">surprisingly robust</a> in both its short term and long term improvements. &nbsp;Of course, I would be remiss if I didnt mention that there have been criticisms, most of which have been gathered <a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#criticism" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p>The N-Back task falls into two main branches in terms of variation, (1) the type of stimulus and (2) the number of turns one must remember 'back.' &nbsp;The type of stimulus currently varies between audio, spatial, color, and shape (commonly with the first two fulfilling the role). &nbsp;One of the most important elements of the task is maintaining multiple channels of focus by doing two things at once, hence the task is usually referred to as <strong>Dual</strong> N-Back. &nbsp;The default for most software is Sound and Spatial position (see illustration) but I've found color and spatial to work equally well and much easier to use since it does not require headphones.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 450px;" src="/storage/n-back-images/n_back_test.gif?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1312941010777" alt="" /></span></span></p>
<p><br />The N in N-Back refers to the number of turns back one must recall. &nbsp;This varies from 1 to as high as around 15. &nbsp;9-back was the highest I've ever heard of anyone reaching, yet the potential is there for far greater numbers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>A D K F <span style="text-decoration: underline;">K</span> E F J <span style="text-decoration: underline;">F</span> T Y D <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Y</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span> W E Q&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>So, go out and try some. &nbsp;One of the more interesting elements of N-Back is the near linear improvement from daily use. &nbsp;While there is some plateauing at some of the more difficult numbers (namely 4 and 5-back) improvement appears to be nearly linear; i.e. more NBack == better working memory.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><span><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_SoP7u0HNsxw/Scu_qNosMoI/AAAAAAAAAH0/hDn2LxDJRpc/s400/fig5.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1312941028123" alt="" /></span><span class="thumbnail-caption" style="width: 400px;">via Jaeggi</span></span></p>
<p>Back to that longer and more detailed article I mentioned earlier, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ" target="_blank">Gwern's N-Back FAQ</a> has just about everything else you would be interested in regarding the task. &nbsp;How many a day? What are the limits? Single or Dual NBack? etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm quite curious to see how my improvements hold up to Jaeggi's mean data, and while I am a bit less diligent then the peer-reviewed researchers, I'll be happy to post my own improvement after the break come October 1st.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a dozen or so options for doing N-Backs on your computer (and even one offline, see FAQ at the bottom). &nbsp;On the desktop there are various programs on every major OS along with a few good browser-based games such as <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://bit.ly/ptpGNK " target="_blank">SoakYourHead</a>. &nbsp;I've since posted a review of the various Android options <a href="http://www.limitlesschannels.com/main/2011/8/10/android-n-back-app-comparison.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>...Microblogging and mobile devices appear to augment human social capabilities, which raises the question whether they remove cognitive or biological constraints on human communication.<strong>&nbsp;In this paper we analyze a dataset of Twitter conversations collected across six months involving 1.7 million individuals and test the theoretical cognitive limit on the number of stable social relationships known as Dunbar's number. We find that the data are in agreement with Dunbar's result; users can entertain a maximum of 100&ndash;200 stable relationships.</strong>&nbsp;Thus, the &lsquo;economy of attention&rsquo; is limited in the online world by cognitive and biological constraints as predicted by Dunbar's theory.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191760161">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I read little fantasy so picking up this one was an interesting experience for me.  Especially given the setting and scope of the storyline, as a book of dream made flesh within the coastal world of contemporary New Jersey.  Ekaterina Sedia's writing is an incredible mixture of moment-by-moment brilliance and insightful self-awareness.  The book does such a fantastic job of fronting an elegant and convincing tale with this interplay between such classical allegories of storytelling and utterly original characters.  While some characters are far more fleshed-out then others (haha, disregard that for the uninitiated), such as the protagonist Vimbai, each adds an interesting perspective and unique elements brought to the tale.  The writing is at times terribly gripping yet succinct enough to revel in its simplicity.  An excellent read and something off the beaten path for I would assume nearly every reader given the unique blend of simulcra meta analysis, fantasy elements, and quite simply solid writing.

<p>The always great Mind Hacks recently posted a link to a NYT Opinion piece on the perspective Brazilians have on plastic surgery. &nbsp;I observed this quite a bit when I was down in Brazil and it was fascinating. &nbsp;I've been looking for a piece on this for some time, so <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/a-necessary-vanity/" target="_blank">here it is</a>.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After seeing the parade, I began to notice that Rio&rsquo;s plastic surgery clinics were almost as numerous as beauty parlors (and there are a lot of those).&nbsp; Newsstands sold magazines with titles like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.plasticaebeleza.com.br/">Pl&aacute;stica &amp; Beauty</a>, next to Marie Claire.&nbsp; I assumed that the popularity of cosmetic surgery in a developing nation was one more example of Brazil&rsquo;s gaping inequalities.&nbsp; But Pitanguy had long maintained that plastic surgery was not only for the rich: &ldquo;The poor have the right to be beautiful, too,&rdquo; he has said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis and plastic surgery, both once maverick medical specialties, overlapped closely in their historical development.&nbsp; While the &ldquo;talking cure&rdquo; treated bodily complaints via the mind, plastic surgery healed mental suffering via the body.&nbsp; Historian Sander Gilman called plastic surgery &ldquo;psychoanalysis in reverse.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Brazil, as in Argentina, psychoanalysis enjoyed extraordinary popularity among wealthier Brazilians. But many veterans of Freudian or Lacananian therapy have supplemented or supplanted it with pl&aacute;stica. For the patients at public hospitals, psychoanalysis had never been &ldquo;an option,&rdquo; a psychologist who worked in Pitanguy&rsquo;s clinic told me. Echoing the words of the mischievous Carnival designer, she explained, &ldquo;The poor prefer surgery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I watched from an observation room as a clinician sat at a computer that monitors pitch and asked Caroline to hold certain vowel sounds for as long as she could. To me, her voice sounded quite feminine, but Caroline was tough on herself: After one assessment, she guessed that her pitch was 145. (Anything between 145 and 165 is considered gender neutral.) The clinician reassured her: The real number was 198, very close to the average range of feminine pitch of 210-220. Caroline then read a passage selected to contain all the sounds in the English language. This time, her average pitch was 177, just above gender neutral. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t find my voice,&rdquo; says Caroline, disappointed. She also had work to do on her laugh, her cough, and her sneeze.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191769677">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Orwell's writing is solid and he tells a fascinating story on a piece of history seldom covered.  While there can be no such thing as unbaised writing in such a emotional context, he seems to remain quite neutral yet comes across as both passionate and objective.  The strength of the writing is in Orwell's straightforward storytelling where he retains the journalist style to document what he might term only the essentials leading to elevation of each word as more than just passing description but the purest character-defining attributes.

<p>from University of Texas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;ADHD is not about inattention,&rdquo; Gilden says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disorder in the way people thread moment-to-moment experiences together. Children with ADHD are often disruptive because their world is moving at a much faster pace and there&rsquo;s always going to be a mismatch between their world and ours.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>As part of his research, Gilden measured how people with and without the disorder tap along to the beat of a metronome. The respondents then continue tapping at the same pace for three minutes after the metronome stops. Although both groups were able to tap to the beat at 60 beats per minute, the participants with ADHD lost the rhythm when the tempo slowed down to 40 beats per minute.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The slower the tempo, the more likely people with ADHD will be less internally consistent with themselves,&rdquo; Gilden says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re inattentive, it&rsquo;s just that their world is moving along at a slightly faster clip.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>...Gilden says&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;This is a very puzzling discovery because although their minds are moving at a faster rate, they&rsquo;re actions are more spacious.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>

<p>Summed up from Okubo: "<em>People tend to adopt the most effective manner in which their hemispheric functions can be utilised."</em></p>
<p><em>*Sidenote for the uninitiated: Due to the cross-wiring of our brains, by positioning oneself to view the screen more directly with the left eye acting dominantly, the right hemisphere processes the majority of the input.</em></p>

BODY:
<p><em>Journal Entry: mostly for me a stream of conscious thought map but if anyone gets anything out of this, should make good conversational fodder, come find me.</em></p>

<p>It's easy to over think one's own influential reach. &nbsp;I can be hesistant to bring up a topic I've discussed or merely referenced in passing many times yet the assumption of my own influence on my social circles is easily over estimated. &nbsp;It is for nearly everyone. &nbsp;My first reaction to this is one of cynicism and negativity, but perhaps that is unrealistic or just silly. &nbsp;To assume that your audience is familiar with your own output to that extreme and in such a complete way is somewhat absurd, but even with the brutal honesty of such a myth of object reality it is the wrong approach. &nbsp;The better approach and one I've only recently come upon is seeing the incredible potential to driving forth one's point; taking advantage in repeating oneself and with each repetition clarifying and perfecting one's expression and argument. &nbsp;Not only that but the acceptance of such exercises as self-expression. &nbsp;Self-expression in this sense referring to the way one can become a characteture in another's eyes. &nbsp;Often times in everyday conversation (IRL since my online and real world presence is quite clearly separate, just as any person separates their life, but&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">that is another post entirely</span>) I like to bring up once of my clearest and most long-lasting literary impressions: the character of Vaughn as presented in J.G. Ballard's novel Crash.</p>

<div><p>   Vaughn is perhaps one of the most interesting and well fleshed out characters I've ever read. &nbsp;He is complete while retaining a certain mystique. &nbsp;The wholeness of the character is fascinating because of the concreteness of that character mystique, namely that it is not an allure of occult (in the truest sense, hidden) traits but instead a total character awareness. &nbsp;What I would call an overabundance of self-awareness. &nbsp;The way Vaughn carries himself is described as that of a model. &nbsp;In every single movement, he <em>performs.</em>&nbsp; His every action from an orgasmic thrust of his hips to the picking up of a wrench is described as the practiced, demonstrative movements of one modelling on camera. &nbsp;In reading this my revelation came in the total lack of separation between construed and true reality. &nbsp;The classic "fake it till you make it" is the real takeaway. &nbsp;If one is constantly in character then that is who they become. &nbsp;Just like one of the more classic behavioral techniques where one can force a smile regardless of one's true feelings. By faking a smile one eventually begins to truly feel the smile, becoming happier.</div></p>
<div></div>
<div><p>   True, in writing this I am "in the zone" in that special writer mode where one's mind is constantly spidering out into the most obscure and vaguely related topics that only make sense to the writer themselves. &nbsp;Or perhaps it lies in the difficulty of writing this as my hands tremor with caffeine. &nbsp;The separation between presentation to others and the four-track mind a person is constantly blazing through can only feeblely be expressed in such an opening as <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/71x/a_crash_course_in_the_neuroscience_of_human/" target="_blank">this LessWrong article</a> or <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://xkcd.com/920/" target="_blank">this XKCD</a> piece. &nbsp;That meta-awareness is what I so greatly admire in incredible writers (see the break midway through Egger's "Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" or nearly any work of Charlie Kauffman's). &nbsp;It is truly an incredibly skill to more accurately merge one's thought-train with a reasonable facsimile in external expression. &nbsp;Maybe that is the goal of my obsession with the bounty of self-awareness. &nbsp;Accurate external expression can occur from playing a part, when one lacks the skill to fully express themselves.</div></p>
<div></div>
<div><p>   The "fake it till you make it" method has also become one of the predominant techniques in the field of pick up artistery as of late. &nbsp;Real Social Dynamics (RSD), one premier method and pioneering company, basis their entire approach no longer on the previous call-and-response style multiple-choice method but instead on 'natural modelling.' &nbsp;Naturals are those who are naturally good at picking up women. &nbsp;Nearly everyone has known a person like this, those who constantly have a partner and seem to expel next to no effort in doing so. &nbsp;RSD concentrates on modelling every part of the behavior of these naturals and through emulation internalizing the behavior. &nbsp;By conditioning and internalizing such behavior one <em>becomes</em>&nbsp;a natural.</div></p>
<div></div>
<div><p>   In terms of bridging that gap further between internalized behavior and surpressing abundant self-awareness, I have been reading about Charles Munger recently. &nbsp;Charles Munger is one of the closest friends and key advisors to Warren Buffet, quite possibly the richest man on Earth. &nbsp;Charles Munger is no slouch in his own right with a estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. &nbsp;In reading Tim Ferriss' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Four Hour Body</span> recently I came upon a fascinating aside about Munger and how he has honed his mind over his lifetime into becoming an absolutely incredible human risk-assessment machine. &nbsp;Using an estimated 80-90 mental models he has compiled and studied over the years in multiple disciplines leading to as Ferriss quotes Warrent Buffet himself "<em>'The best 30-second mind in the world. &nbsp;He goes from A to Z in one move. &nbsp;He sees the essence of everything before you even finish the sentence.'&nbsp;</em>"</div></p>
<div></div>
<div><p>   Incredible. &nbsp;The ability to completely and wholy internalize such analytical tools to the point where one can instantaneously assess nearly any problem presented is easily one of most impressive and admirable goals I think I've ever heard. &nbsp;I've been vaguely interested in this every since I read Frank Herbert's Dune. &nbsp;In a extremely brief and probably misguided description of the class of people known as Mentats (link for better descript) I would simply describe them as human calculators. &nbsp;After a massive war between machines (having reached the singularity or some such thing) and humans the humans no longer trust machines and have basically honed different individuals into human calculators and Charles Mungers. &nbsp;While Mentats tend to be more adept at wartime calculation and Munger the field of finance and business, the principle is the same. &nbsp;To close the gap between the conscious and unconscious mind to the point where one melds their consciousness into a reality assessment tool and becomes no longer a surface, external form and an internal dialogue looks to me like fulfillment of what some call "becoming a complete human."</div></p>
</div>

<p>So, go get started.  Keeping with the theme the Luddites have a compiled <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.ludism.org/mentat/HomePage" target="_blank">a nice Mentat Wiki resource</a></p>

<p>A study on "digit span" (how many numbers one can remember when quickly presented in succession) in Cantonese language speakers and English speakers has shown that on average Chinese speakers have greater digit span. &nbsp;This happens due to the brevity of the monosyllabic Cantonese digits leading to greater stringing together of subsequent numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This difference in memory span between Cantonese and English may be attributed to the faster pronunciation speed and the intonation built into the Cantonese language. The nonlinear probability of recall curves for nonnative English speakers is a key to understanding the differences in memory span and the applicability of short-term memory models.</p>

<p>It was such a kickass experience I've since posted this to Yelp but straight out of my journal on my recent voyage to NYC. &nbsp;Sorry if it's all "reviewy" in style but that's kind of the point, catering to a crowd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I wanted to grab a drink after work with a friend before we headed home and he tattooed me (that's right) so we stopped in at a bar that we had heard about when another coworker said "they play weird shit on TV like castration films and stuff." &nbsp;Well, we were sold.<br /><br />We arrived, got some beers (IPA!) and admired the sweet Babes in Toyland and metal paraphernalia around. &nbsp;A few minutes in our bartender was up on the bar dancing on the pole and kicking music's ass. &nbsp;When she got down the spot was quickly taken up by another patron and the night was on. &nbsp;The bartender asked us if we had ever been there before and we said we hadn't so she gave us the rundown. &nbsp;Tonight was tuesday, that meant it was DJ and go-go dancer night! &nbsp;That's tuesdays and thursdays, btw. &nbsp;In little under an hour the DJ and three dancers would stop by and make our evening killer. &nbsp;Running a quick bit of arithmetic at the current rate that would outnumber the actual customers, but hey, this is the place that &nbsp;brings its own party. &nbsp;Furthermore the Troma (or is it Fullmoon?) classic Poultrygeist was on the TV and the violent satanic chicken battle offered perfect backdrop to the night. &nbsp;It was also a couple people's birthdays that night so our bartender presented the skeleton beer bong to us soon to be filled, then refilled, then refilled some more.<br /><br />I was pretty damn pissed when I had to go home after one beer and get some ink but damned if it wasn't the marker for exactly why I need to visit NYC more often. &nbsp;And next time, it sure as hell will be my birthday.</p>

<p>Probably shouldn't try this one at home yet, but BBC has a new article on the use of electricity in increasing the brain's susceptibility to learning new patterns. &nbsp;In the study the participants received light electrical stimulation leading to quicker learning in terms of motor tasks. &nbsp;Hopefully future research can use this stimulation applied to other regions of the brain, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of the button-pressing experiments showed the positive effects of just 10 minutes of the brain stimulation on learning, compared to a similar "placebo" setup in which the electrical stimulation was not used.</p>
<p>"While the stimulation didn't improve the participant's best performance, the speed at which they reached their best was significantly increased," said Prof Johansen-Berg.</p>
<p>Targeting the area of the brain that controls motor skills allows movement tasks to be learned more quickly, and the researchers envisage the technique could be used to help in the training of athletes.</p>
<p>The experiments have explicitly shown that stimulating the motor cortex of the brain can increase the speed of learning motor skills.</p>

BODY:
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the proposal that individual differences in belief will reflect cognitive processing styles, with high functioning autism being an extreme style that will predispose towards nonbelief (atheism and agnosticism). This view was supported by content analysis of discussion forums about religion on an autism website (covering 192 unique posters), and by a survey that included 61 persons with HFA. Persons with autistic spectrum disorder were much more likely than those in our neurotypical comparison group to identify as atheist or agnostic, and, if religious, were more likely to construct their own religious belief system. Nonbelief was also higher in those who were attracted to systemizing activities, as measured by the Systemizing Quotient.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...[from conclusion]:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We suggest that individual differences in cognitive styles is an important predictor of human belief systems, including religious belief. An extreme type of cognitive style is high functioning autism. The 2 studies reported here found that individuals with HFA have a higher rate than neurotypicals of endorsing atheism and agnosticism. HFA individuals thus resemble another group of high-systemizers (scientists), who also reject religious belief at a relatively high rate.</p>

<p>Just a brief excerpt from a much more fascinating complete debate, make sure to click through. &nbsp;In response to musings by Grandin, an animal scientist, in some of his best-selling books some members of the neuroscience community have responded with some great observations on either side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...[in response to Grandin] the authors argue, rather than having privileged access to lower level sensory information before it is packaged into concepts, as has been argued for savants, animals, like non-autistic humans, process sensory inputs according to rules, and that this manner of processing is a specialized feature of the left hemisphere in humans and nonhuman animals.</p>
<p>At the most general level, they argue, "the left hemisphere sets up rules based on experience and the right hemisphere avoids rules in order to detect details and unique features that allow it to decide what is familiar and what is novel. This is true for human and nonhuman animals, likely reflecting ancient evolutionary origins of the underlying brain mechanisms."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this new paper, Moser et al. extends this research by looking at how beliefs about learning shape these mostly involuntary error-related signals in the brain, both of which appear in less than half a second....</p>
<p>It turned out that those subjects with a growth mindset were significantly better at learning from their mistakes. As a result, they showed a spike in accuracy immediately following an error. Most interesting, though, was the EEG data, which demonstrated that those with a growth mindset generated a much larger Pe signal, indicating increased attention to their mistakes. (While those with an extremely fixed mindset generated a Pe amplitude around five, those with a growth mindset were closer to fifteen.) What&rsquo;s more, this increased Pe signal was nicely correlated with improvement after error, implying that the extra awareness was paying dividends in performance. Because the subjects were thinking about what they got wrong, they learned how to get it right.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that both groups performed equivalently on all measures of cognitive performance, the scans of the bilingual patients showed twice as much atrophy in areas of the brain known to be affected by Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Dr. Schweizer said that because bilingual people constantly switch from one language to another or suppress one language to speak in the other, their brains may be better prepared to compensate through enhanced brain networks or pathways when Alzheimer's sets in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To evolve and to ensure the best possible conditions for us and our offspring's survival seems to me a perfectly good replacement for religion as a source of moral structure, and a source of life guidance.</p>
<p>I feel perfectly well assuming my goal in life to be to work to adapt to the environment, and secure my genes' continued survival in the best possible conditions. Ultimately, all of my life choices come down to evolutionary strategies that either succeed or fail. Why do we get up in the morning and go to school and have jobs? So we can have a better life? Why have a better life? So we can better ensure our survival.</p>
<p>Moral values appear naturally as soon as we start living together as a group. Harm against our own kind is for most cases detrimental for our survival as a group, or as a species. A balance between personal needs and the needs of the group must be achieved. The golden rule would be not to interfere with other peoples' evolutionary strategies, as long as they don't interfere with yours.</p>
<p>At the same time, evolution is a concept that must necessarily adapt to its context, which makes for a much better guideline than an immutable rule that becomes outdated with changing conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, if we assume that every other organism on the planet has the same goal as we do, it becomes much easier to reason at the same level and gain empathy towards what is essentially the same thing as us.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin apparently tried his hand at a bit of phonetics work in reforming the American spelling and writing system after the break from British English. &nbsp;This stuff actually happened a lot back then (Noah Webster largely responsible) including simply altering the spelling of common words to differentiate themselves from British English, like taking the "u" out of color. &nbsp;Benjamin Frankling did a decent job of his new system in preserving oft-missed features like vowel length and variations between fricatives and plosives.</p>

<p>The ideas of these "newer methods of statistical analysis" the article mentions aren't really the case. &nbsp;I have personally discussed such work with one of the people working on DARPA's (then ARPA's) translation work as early as 1971. &nbsp;Google didn't pioneer this but the beauty of Google is and has always been the sheer mountain of capital they can throw at an issue that appears to have next to no real utility in their business model.</p>
<p>While for many it may seem obvious we are really just statistical engines and pattern recognition is the path to language, there is a reason that rule-based theory has gotten as far as it has. &nbsp;The robustness of Chomsky's generative linguistics (the mechanism) and his theory of universal grammar (the idea) has been tested for many years and still holds shockingly well today. &nbsp;Even if we are analytical engines we may have somehow still found a ruleset that matches every language presented. &nbsp;Or maybe we just found a limitation in human ingenuity instead where we simply can't move past patterning our speech in a consistent manner.</p>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/224103899">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
What can I say about one of those books you have known of for ages but just got around to.  I guess that covers most books, so nothing that hasn't been said before.  Snow Crash is one of the oldest and most influential cyberpunk novels (next to Gibson's <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22328.Neuromancer" title="Neuromancer by William Gibson">Neuromancer</a>) and deserving of its fame.  Probably the most remarkable thing about such a novel is the brutal relevance with which it continues to echo.  Ideas of the metaverse and future (or presence) of the tech world, the decimation of govt in favor of corporate rule, and even the perpetuity of human nature.<br/><br/>I have issues with books that are written in a goofy/absurdist writing style and it takes me a while to get over such a key feature of a novel.  Once my annoyance with that abated I enjoyed the work far more.<br/><br/>The best stories are those that are built within a world of equally good ideas; ones that touch on universes unique enough to bread countless other stories (and often do with sequel after sequel). In this way Snow Crash is an excellent story.  Perhaps if I had read this once it was released it would have deeply affected me, but having read it only recently many of the ideas were ones I have already become quite familiar with, for one William S. Burroughs 1970 <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257504.The_Electronic_Revolution" title="The Electronic Revolution by William S. Burroughs">The Electronic Revolution</a> and idea of language as a virus.  While this take is one of tech and a bit less occult my own knowledge of cogsci hurts the feasibility of such an idea within my mind, as romantic as it is.  Maybe I'm just dead inside.<br/><br/>The characters within Snow Crash and incredibly engaging and one of the strongest elements of the novel.  Y.T. is a charismatic teenage girl and probably the closest thing we get to an audience surrogate.  Hiro is likely the most talented man alive and what's not to like about that?  Sword-wielding hacker extraordinaires are rarely boring.  Even the real antagonist of the story, <spoiler>the Aleut Raven,</spoiler> was a fully-fleshed and powerful character for any novel on his own.  <spoiler>He is of course the true antagonist for maybe the absurdist style, or the fact that Neal Stephenson doesn't treat you like an idiot, shows the foe-antagonist as a fat, rich media-mogul with an evily-twisted mustache</spoiler>.<br/><br/>I learned things from this novel and that's probably the highest praise I can give a book.

<p>I&#39;m not sure what bothers me about it exactly but it just seems goofy and annoys me.  Most things that annoy me are pretty irrational so it is probably just a pet peeve of mine.  I would like to think that language is a virus but the more I learn about language and neuroscience the less true it seems.  Language itself isn&#39;t a virus but maybe just an instrument of the mimetic virus.  Just thinking, I&#39;m not really too committed to any of these ideas right now.</p>

<p>I still think Snow Crash is one of the most run novels I have ever read.  For me it is the closest thing I have ever found that is like a summer Hollywood blockbuster in book form.</p><p>but I do now have to admit that I might totally understand your annoyance with the goofy style.

<p>Radvansky found that the subjects forgot more after walking through a doorway compared to moving the same distance across a room,<strong> suggesting that the doorway or &ldquo;event boundary&rdquo; impedes one&rsquo;s ability to retrieve thoughts or decisions made in a different room.</strong></p>

<p>Some awesome work on circadian rhythms of cloistered monks in France. &nbsp;Originally started to measure sleep patterns of their biphasic sleep (interrupted by a couple hours of prayer) the researchers started studying the effects of such sleep patterns (or maybe the cloistering... although there was a control I couldn't tell which of these the control was used for). &nbsp;Key interesting result: even after decades, the monks bodies had not adjusted to the awkward sleep cycle. &nbsp;Polyphasic aint for everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the report &ldquo;Trends in Machine Translation,&rdquo; Common Sense Advisory explains the need for MT, discusses the major trends pushing it to be integrated into many more applications, and outlines the impact on organizations that should be employing machine translation.<br /><br />&rdquo;Machine translation was long characterized as a complex, expensive technology requiring a lot of computing horsepower. In 1956, if you wanted MT, you had to go to the United States Navy or to the KGB to get it. Today, the options for using MT ranged from desktop to in-house server to free online access,&rdquo; explains DePalma ... "By adding MT to their content mix, they&rsquo;ll lower the language barrier and open their companies to more global buyers.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Trends in Machine Translation&rdquo; outlines five megatrends affecting machine translation: 1) the burgeoning acceptance of machine translation; 2) the demystification around the concept and practice of MT; 3) the enterprise-enabling of the technology; 4) the development of an ecosystem around machine translation; and 5) its changing business model and economics.</p>
<p><span>Adds DePalma, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for everyone to take a serious look at how machine translation fits into their content strategy for international markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what is said in this release on the report is just flat-out wrong, such as "<span><em>For post-edited MT, quality is already equivalent to human translation in many cases.</em></span>" &nbsp;I am in no way a conservative humanist in the "machines can never equal us" silly way, but I pay a lot of attention to this research and today's techniques and that isn't correct. &nbsp;Still, it is a topic that is more and more relevant and will continue to move forward whether or not it actually works apparently, so we better get cracking on a more correct (efficiency has reached a fine point, but we need clarity and correctness now) method.</p>

<p>Translation is not only about producing an accurate piece, it is also about the cultural aspect. Machine translations will hopefully never replace translations made by humans. Translation is a high skill. Translators need to be able to decode the source text and to produce a translation that reads naturally in the target language in order to convey the meaning properly. A professional translation company</a> can provide these services.</p>

It is an excellent volume covering just about every element one must know to have a solid base in phonetics.  The breakdown favors native English speakers, (and American ones in the US edition, at least) first providing a clear description of the phonetics of English including prosodic features, consonants, and vowels before moving on to all other sound systems.  It is fantastically complete given the size.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the volume lies in the insightful walkthroughs on producing some of the more difficult sounds, using such hints as how to determine which method of articulation one uses to produce the American English "R."  To determine whether one bunch the tongue or curl the tip up, carefully insert a toothpick between one's teeth and judging by the point of contact on the surface or bottom of the tongue, it is easy to figure out.  Other techniques, such as sucking in air to feel exposed areas for laterals, all provide extremely helpful ways of both identifying and articulating nearly all sounds.  Furthermore, each chapter end includes a bevvy of performance exercises one can use to practice and alternate between sounds, getting down the rhythm of expression.<br /><br />One of the only real weaknesses to the volume is in the CD portion.  While immensely helpful, the CD was not updated between the 5th and 6th edition (even though it has "6th" printed on it).  The exercises on the CD therefore do not match those in the book, yet it is really only a different order so still usable.  On that point, I really noticed no differences between the 5th and 6th edition other than the exercises, which pisses me off to the classic tune of the publisher's release of a new edition for no legitimate reason.  Especially given this book is expensive as sin (I paid around $120 for a new edition).<br /><br />Those bureaucratic complaints aside, this book is the best there is currently for phonetics from of the most important people to have worked in the field.  The illustrations and charts are extremely helpful for driving home points, the aforementioned descriptions are useful, and the glossary in the end is excellent.  If you want to study some phonetics, get this. <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>

BODY:
<div>I have been thinking about the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">Simulation Argument</a>&nbsp;lately. &nbsp;Philosopher Nick Bostrom's Simulation Argument more or less works like this, by first agreeing that one of the following is true:</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a &ldquo;posthuman&rdquo; stage</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof)</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>The argument from there (because rejecting all is not entirely reasonable) follows if (1) or (2) are the case then we simply do not have to think about it, and thus dismiss the argument. &nbsp;The strength here is that there is no theoretical limitation that would prevent us from achieving such simulations. &nbsp;And once we have the technological ability, why not run thousands upon thousands of simulations at once for scientific purposes or mere curiosity. &nbsp;If (3) is the case, then upon realization it may&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;alter are view and experience of everyday behavior. &nbsp;By guessing or determining the belief structure of the simulator one can target or anticipate the effect of specific behavior, whereupon an assumption of the ruleset allows one to "win." &nbsp;This could include something like fulfilling karma-rich dharma behavior to assure one's acceptance into the oneness that is Brahman afterlife.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>What I have been considering though is why the conclusion favors advanced civilizations running simulations of past history. &nbsp;I would assume that any advanced civilization would retain the same goals as the present one, attempting to predict the future. &nbsp;My issue here is the premise that we would use our technology to be reflective, when it would seem more practical to run simulations beginning with the present state and determine the results of the immediate future. &nbsp;The end goal of the simulation argument [and that is assuming one accepts premise (3)] is that probablistically we are living in a simulation right now. &nbsp;While that may be true assuming an advanced civilization would be running historical simulations I would assume that the civilization would run future ones. &nbsp;Since at present we do not have the technology to do this, it cannot be a future simulation and therefore we must not be in a computer simulation.</div>

While enjoyable, I am not sure what makes this book a "classic" or even considered a good book for that matter.  There is a large amount of nontraditional plot choices that come off as rather anticlimactic rather than creatively enigmatic.  While enamored out of the gate with the originality and time constraints provided by the plot, the entire second half of the book seems to go by with little to no development, just a bit more mystery and even less conflict.  In terms of said conflict, that bit amounts to a puzzling zero.  Every mission is carried out more-or-less smoothly, each crew member surviving, and any pseudo-conflict that arises (such as the missile) is quickly and efficiently dealt with.  Apparently everyone is just really competent.  When I discussed this with others many brought up ideas like how man chooses to attack the ship, but each encounter is so mildly addressed that it made me think it to be either a sidenote or some half-baked critique of Clarke's on humanity. <br /> <br />Arthur C. Clarke's writing is as always fantastic, the clear-cut style guides the reader along and makes each reading a relaxing and easy experience.  The scenery is clearly presented, with each reader having a strong geometric understanding of the ship's scope, and the characters are all likeable. <br /> <br />I tend to dislike blatantly cryptic endings.  It is one thing for mystery to be present at all (and for any accurate portrayal of an advanced civilization I would say it has to be) but the lack of conflict, the anticlimactic ending, and the frictionless narrative seems to hurt my overall takeaway from the tale.  Perhaps Arthur C. Clarke merely wanted the verse and wrote Rama for sequels.  So far that's the best I've come up with, but until then, I'll read go read Childhood's End. <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>

BODY:
<div>
<div>Been curious about this for a while and after a few somewhat heated discussions (mainly my heat) with musicians about why the hell scales are the way they are, why pianos are all weird (why no B#, or why that's C), and is the idea of musical&nbsp;dissonance&nbsp;bullshit tradition or legit, I finally found some information. &nbsp;The annoying part to me is how long it has taken me to find this out since apparently people who play music just "get it" or blindly accept it and those who don't don't play music.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I found a post on StackExchange asking exactly what I'm looking for: "<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/11669/mathematical-difference-between-white-and-black-notes-in-a-piano" target="_blank">Mathematical differences between white and black keys on a piano</a>." &nbsp;From there I gathered most of my data and with some other sources, a pretty solid picture of what's going on.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>The question:</h2>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The division of the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale" target="_blank">chromatic scale</a>&nbsp;in 7 natural notes (white keys in a piano) and 5&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_%28music%29" target="_blank">accidental</a>&nbsp;ones (black) seems a bit arbitrary to me.</p>
<p>Mathematically, is there any difference between white and black notes, or do we make the distinction just for historical reasons?</p>
<p>Apparently, adjacent notes in a piano (including white or black) are always separated by a semitone. Why the distinction, then? Why not just have scales with 12 notes? (apparently there's a musical scale called&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swara" target="_blank">Swara</a>&nbsp;that does just that)</p>
<p>I've asked several musician friends, but they lack the math preparation for giving me a valid answer. "Notes are like that because they are like that".</p>
<p>I need some mathematician with musical knowledge (or a musician with mathematical knowledge) to help me out with this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>excerpt from a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/eb49c/mathematical_difference_between_white_and_black/c1cp7cn" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> short answer:</h3>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div><em><strong>"You basically started the scale from any random frequency you wanted (because the intervals are all that's really important in just intonation), and you could had different "modes" depending on what note from the scale was the primary tone in the piece. The two most famous modes are the minor and major scales."</strong></em></div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3>and some excerpts from the longer answers:</h3>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>So, in theory, you can start from an arbitrary frequency (or note) and build a scale of "harmonic" notes using these ratios (I'm using quotes because the term harmonic has a very specific meaning in music, and I'm talking in broad and imprecise terms). The major and minor scales of Western music can be approximately derived from this scheme. Both scales (major and minor) have 7 notes. The white keys in the piano correspond to the major scale, starting from the C note.</p>
<p>Now, if you get the C note and use the "perfect" fractions, you'll get the "true" C major scale. And that's where the fun begins.</p>
<p>If you take any note in the C major scale, you can treat that note as the start of another scale. Take for instance the fifth of C (it's the G), and build a new major scale, now starting from G instead of C. You'll get another seven notes. Some of them are also on the scale of C; others are very close, but not exactly equal; and some fall in the middle of the notes in the scale of C.</p>
<p>If you repeat this exercise with all notes, you'll end up building 12 different scales. The problem is that the interval is not regular, and there are some imprecisions. You need to retune the instrument if you want to have the perfect scale.</p>
<p>The concept of "chromatic" scale (with 12 notes, equaly spaced) was invented to solve this "problem". The chromatic scale is a mathematical approximation, that is close enough for MOST people (but not all). People with "perfect" ear can listen the imperfections.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Another:</div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Twelve half-steps makes up an octave. Why twelve?</strong></div>
<div>
<p>At the end of the day, what we want out of our musical frequencies are nice ratios of small integers. For example, a perfect fifth is supposed to correspond to a frequency ratio of&nbsp;3</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>:2, or&nbsp;1.5:1, but in equal temperament it doesn't; instead, it corresponds to a ratio of&nbsp;2712:1&asymp;1.498:1. As you can see, this is not a fifth; however, it is quite close.</p>
<p>Similarly, a perfect fourth is supposed to correspond to a frequency ratio of&nbsp;4:3, or&nbsp;1.333...:1, but in equal temperament it corresponds to a ratio of&nbsp;2512:1&asymp;1.335:1. Again, this is not a perfect fourth, but is quite close.</p>
<p>And so on. What's going on here is a massively convenient mathematical coincidence: several of the powers of&nbsp;2&radic;12&nbsp;happen to be good approximations to ratios of small integers, and there are enough of these to play Western music.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>
<div>An important comment that I also found was this:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;"Just to add one sentence that is implicit in Qiaochu's answer [the above long answer]: in equal temperament one may as well just have 12 identical keys. But in pythagorean tuning and well-temperament, there's quite a difference between the different keys; hence it is less odd to have the keys not be completely symmetrical. The white keys correspond to the "preferred" diatonic scale of C-major. If you train your ears a bit, you maybe able to hear the difference of, say, Bach's Well-tempered Klavier played on modernly tuned instrument versus a well-tempered one. "</div>
<p>Here's how this coincidence works. You get the white keys from&nbsp;C&nbsp;using (part of) the circle of fifths. Start with&nbsp;C&nbsp;and go up a fifth to get&nbsp;G, then&nbsp;D, then&nbsp;A, then&nbsp;E, then&nbsp;B. Then go down a fifth to get&nbsp;F. These are the "neighbors" of&nbsp;C&nbsp;in the circle of fifths. You get the black keys from here using the rest of the circle of fifths. After you've gone up a "perfect" perfect fifth twelve times, you get a frequency ratio of&nbsp;312:212&asymp;129.7:1. This happens to be rather close to&nbsp;27:1, or seven octaves!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an additional link on the keyboard <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard#Size_and_historical_variation" target="_blank">Wikipedia on Size and Historical Variations</a></p>
<h2>&nbsp;And finally, a note on dissonance:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><span>The Greeks had a lot of interest in mathemathics, and it seemed "right" for them to search for "perfect" combinations&mdash;perfect meaning that they should be expressed in terms of fractions of small integer numbers. They noticed that if you double or halve the string length, you get the same note (the concept of an octave); other fractions, such as 2/3, 3/4, also produced "harmonic" combinations. That's also the reason why some combinations sound better, as it can be explained by physics. When you combine several sine waves, you hear several different notes that are the result of the interference betwen the original waves. Some combinations sound better while others produce what we call "disonance".</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The StackExchange page is gloriously long with a variety of different explanations for the same thing. I encourage others to read through and try and check out as many as possible. &nbsp;For me, each different explanation just provided me with a clearer understanding of what's going on. &nbsp;Now I'm starting to get it.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EDIT: </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everyone who has gotten this far should make sure to read Sarah's beautifully thorough comment below going into each issue in the clearest way yet.</span></p>

<p>I&#39;ll start by flat out agreeing that the division of the chromatic scale and the distribution of piano keys is absolutely arbitrary. In my music studies, I got the overwhelming impression that there is a a belief that the division into twelfths is a magically, naturally existing phenomenon, which is ill-informed but not surprising to me. Equal temperament wasn&#39;t even &quot;discovered&quot; until sometime early in the 1700s and its main purpose seems to be for mechanistic tone production consistency, specifically for keyed instruments. Also, this distribution and consequent tuning tends to be blindly accepted as <i>correct</i> and <i>modern</i> by contemporary musicians because the 12-note division represents how it has always been. Red flag.</p><p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/music/et.html" rel="nofollow">Equal temperament (ET)</a> tuning is essentially an estimate that generally falls on pleasant-enough interval definitions but is imperfect; it requires the musician to play based on static sound frequencies rather than pure sound intervals. Just temperament, in contrast, requires that each scale being used has its own tuning. Essentially, this is playing by ear but it requires that the musician(s) have instruments that allow real-time adjustment. (There is also a Pythagorean temperament that I know very little about.) </p><p>Ideally, the third, fourth and fifth would all have very clean interval ratios (such as 5:4 for a major third, 3:2 for a fifth). However, on the ET circle of fifths the purity of the intervals is sacrificed in order to create the circle itself. Starting from C, the twelve steps around the circle of fifths would be C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C# - A♭/G# - E♭ - B♭ - F - C. These begin to be off by several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)" rel="nofollow">cents</a> (100 cents is a twelfth of an octave) about halfway through and by the end the final C is about a quarter semitone too high--this discrepancy, actually quite displeasing to the ear, is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_(music)" rel="nofollow">comma</a>.</p><p>Dealing with your question about why don&#39;t we just have a scale with twelve notes, twelve notes aren&#39;t even ideal. It seems better (at least in my opinion) to base all tuning off the tonic of the scale that defines the key signature because this allows the ideal ratios to be achieved for all degrees of the scale. There are plenty of musical traditions where this is the case, anyway. I can see how this would create issues when large ensembles were playing together, though, which is a central argument for ET. Because this standardized division of the soundscape into twelve chromatic steps allows the third, fourth and fifth to occur with less than ~5¢ discrepancy range; since the majority of Western music relies on these intervals to build stable chords, it is suitable.</p><p>Today the standard pitch on which everything is built is and A at 440 Hz. There is evidence, though, that the standard pitches across Europe varied by as much as 75 Hz meaning that a town in Germany might tune from a note at 392 Hz producing music strikingly different from a French town that based harmony on a note at 465 Hz. This results in inaccurate playing of period music. For example, Baroque music should be based on a lower frequency than today&#39;s standard. </p><p>As a last thought, it is interesting to consider that our understanding (from a Western European perspective) of music theory almost makes it impossible to notate and recreate musical traditions based on interval purity or &quot;non-standard&quot; chord clusters because the frequencies produced do not exist in the 12-piece chromatic distribution of sound that is created. This used to be more in line with musical notation: an A♭ and a G#, now the &quot;same note,&quot; actually would not have sounded the same before with the A♭ being slightly lowered and the G# slightly raised depending on key. The existence of two or more notations for the same sound now exist for theoretical chord-building reasons rather than to describe discrete sounds.</p><p>You might like to check out some of the <a href="http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/Physicsofmusic.html" rel="nofollow">Michigan Tech physics of music page</a> as well as <a href="http://leware.net/temper/temper.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a> dealing with temperaments in general. You could also probably get your hands on the book &quot;How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (and Why You Should Care)&quot; by Ross W. Duffin.</p>

BODY:
<div>So I finally joined Diaspora. &nbsp;The invitation has been sitting in my inbox for a good month or so and having lost interest within the months of their glacial development pace, I simply had no interest. &nbsp;Having a bit of spare time today and feeling like a testing mood, I tried it out. &nbsp;Here's some impressions:</div>
<br />
<h2>First Impressions:</h2>
<div>Diaspora appears to be just a blatant blend of Twitter and Google+. &nbsp;It is basically just twitter's hashtags and @mentions (both directly called such) plus circles. &nbsp;The irony is that it really makes for a great experience. &nbsp;I've been saying since G+'s launch that there is a strong need for metadata. &nbsp;My "Android Developer" circle on G+ frankly sucks since I could care less about the developer's lives and merely want updates on my latest roms and software. &nbsp;The issue is that the only differentiation is by users, not users' posts. &nbsp;Hashtags were recently added, yes, but until everyone is volitionally&nbsp;labeling&nbsp;things or it's built-in, it's damn near useless.</div>
<br />
<div>But back to Diaspora. &nbsp;Ringing in yet another twitter comparison, or perhaps social networking in general, it has that distinctive shouting-into-the-void feel to it. &nbsp;While nice for sharing myself, it's less nice for getting feedback. &nbsp;The interface is clean and quite minimal, the post groups (i.e. Google+ Circles) are called "aspects" which I rather like. &nbsp;Diaspora seems to takes a more humanist approach to Google's (perpetually engineer-based and blunt) venn diagram joke.</div>
<br />
<div>As far as I can tell, I cannot import my Twitter friends, which is if nothing else annoying. &nbsp;Facebook importing seems to work, which found all three of my friends also on Diaspora. &nbsp;A couple hashtag interest searches have netted me people to follow yet in terms of stream quality at the moment, its visually pleasing, utility light. &nbsp;Lots of art sharing, little news sharing. &nbsp;I have never been big on finding the pretty things on the internet so until some better info sources find their way onto Diaspora, I won't be visiting for my daily dose.</div>
<br />
<div>Diaspora is well-constructed and could be potentially awesome. &nbsp;Unfortunately, its pretty late to the game and if its one strength over Google+ (metadata posts) makes it over to Google, I won't have much purpose hanging around.</div>

Larson</a><br /> My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/214560743">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br /> There's always more room for making syntax approachable.  Few want to read Chomsky's god-awful, giant (and often imparsable) sentences (see <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://rubberducky.org/cgi-bin/chomsky.pl" target="_blank">Chomsky Bot</a>) so there is always a need for more approachable writing on Generative Grammar.  The beauty of this book, however, is also one of its largest downfalls.  Taking the "logic of argumentation" approach provides a fantastic, solid basis by which to learn grammar and leave readers with a very thorough understanding of it.  The problem with this approach is that if one does not read the book in its entirety, they will be left in many ways worse off than they would have been with a different book.  One will slowly learn method and the reasoning behind such a structure as the incredibly simple "everything is a daughter of S and sister to eachother" approach before immediately abandoning it in the next chapter when a problem presents itself.  Chapter by chapter previous approaches are skillfully and concisely explained leaving the reader with a thorough grasp on why theory has moved the direction it has.  Yet with each chapter one's previous understanding is dashed to pieces creating a cycle of critical thinking and reanalysis, beautifully mirroring both the history and the processes involved in generative syntactic theory.  In the end, the conclusion comes about rather abruptly as well, making the cumulative approach anticlimactic.  The book would greatly benefit from a "further reading recommendations" list or even a solid couple of pages of summary, instead of the preexisting two short paragraphs.<br /><br />First and foremost, this book is an excellent introduction to logic of argumentation, yet with a framing in syntax.  You will learn syntax, learn it well, and learn it clearly.  Just make sure your reading is a complete one since it is a bit too easy to wander off the path early and arrive at the wrong conclusion.<br /> <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>

<p>New translations are fun, apparently this year a new edition of The Bible in Norwegian has been released and its ben incredibly well-received. &nbsp;While lightly addressed in the article, i'm curious how many bought it for true religious reasons or just to update their collection or read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty consultant translators, priests and academics translated the Greek and Hebrew original into Norwegian for the new edition, with a team of 12 literary authors including Knausg&aring;rd and playwright Jon Fosse then smoothing out that text. "Obviously it was very important to get the right translation but they also wanted it to be readable, to make sure it was good literary language," said Smemo Strachan. "None of these authors are religious - they are all just very good literary writers who thought it would be an interesting project to be involved in."</p>
<p>&nbsp;...</p>
<p>A "literary" version of the Bible, with no chapters or verses which "reads like a novel", has also been published and has "sold incredibly well", said the publisher.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.norway.org.uk/aboutnorway/society/people/general/">According to official data, 80% of Norway's population of 4.9m belongs to the Church of Norway</a>, but not all the new edition's purchasers are thought to be buying it for strictly religious religions.</p>
