<p class="blockquote">some notes on my last few months' journey to a more clean and minimal life</p>

I have recently become more obsessed with minimalism and the absurd clutter involved in such a simple matter as material possession.  

A <a href="http://blog.wsj.com/wealth/2008/05/19/the-homeless-billionaire/">recent article in The Wall Street Journal</a> called "the homeless billionaire" features one man who chooses hotels over houses and lives out of a carry-on.  One thing he said really stuck with me in the article:

<p class="blockquote">"First, I don't need it. Secondly, maybe in a bizarre kind of way, I don't want to be dependent on it or have the responsibility. I don't get that much enjoyment out of saying 'I own it' " ~ Nicolas Berggruen</p>

This so clearly articulated what I've come to see as ownership being a burden. I simply don\'t want, nor need all these goods.

For the single best declutter indicator I've found, You just need one question. As one Redditor put it, "What do you classify as emotional weight?" ~<a href="http://reddit.com/u/frennite">Frennite</a>, 25sep2012

Just a few months ago I was living with 5 others in a 3-story house that I was managing.  Partly for the sake of tenant comfort and partly my own compulsive hobbying I had to furnish the house and ended up with a massive cache of goods.  Having finally moved to a small apartment and managed to downsize so much else in my life, I have finally gotten to the point where I could concentrate on my own possessions (having to move everything by hand also definitely helped).  

###Things I've already gotten rid of (and money generated):###
 - $100- Shop tools (ladder, table saw, )
 - $30 - My DVD collection (100 items)
 - $15 - My CD collection (150 items)
 - $0  - My LaserDisc collection (no, I'm not kidding. 20ish items)
 - $267.50- My Book collection (~150 items)
<br />
<strong>Total collected reclaimed cash: $412.50</strong>

###Things I'm still working on:###
 - My final books (ones I'm emotionally invested in, textbooks, reference material)
 - My vinyl collection
 - My record player
 - personal notebooks (see below)
 - clothing (still too much, winter clothes also a bitch)

I have a large collection of personal notes and notebooks I have been meaning to digitize for a long time and as soon as I figure out the best way, I will be scanning and throwing all my notes into Evernote. I've been thinking about just lopping off the spine and feeding them through a feed scanner but I'll need to get one first and deal with the semi-complicated process of collating all the pages.  


##Regarding Digital hoarding##

I've given it some thought and to be honest haven't seen any real pressing need at the moment to reduce my crazy digital stash of pictures, music, photos, movies, tv shows, and other goods.  It is indeed important for me to clean up and organize them but for now between the insanely cheap cost of digital storage and the utility I still seem to get out of re-watching old media, I think I will leave digital goods alone for now.  <a href="/projects.html" target="_blank">Especially considering I plan to generate a hell of a lot more digital data soon.</a>

###Anyway, here are some brief notes on first steps and ways I've minimized my own digital life:###
 - Reduce pictures folder to three things (1) Ideas, for pictures that inspire me to make/do/build something (2) backgrounds (3) photos
 - Streaming music versus local.  While streaming has massive potential and I use it often I still seem to experience connectivity issues constantly, which is a bit absurd seeing as I live in an urban center in the middle of the city in 2012.  Until I experience a bit more stability I'll aim to keep around 20 gigs of my own music locally and cycle it out from my external drive.
 - Uninstall all unused programs
 - (for macs) <a href="http://theverge.com/2012/9/14/3331466/mountain-lion-without-skeumorphism" target="_blank">Reducing skeuomorphism</a>
 - use vim for all word documents that don't need strict formatting. GoogleDocs for those that do.
 - digitize all paper notes (but still write tier-one first notes on paper and type up later.  <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/5818/does-handwriting-assist-memory-retention-more-effectively-than-typing">Why? check the research</a>)
