<p><em>(Update since has just been merged into sidebar links page)</em></p>

<p>I tend to prefer some kind of longform to my blogs; linkdumps have their place (that's what Twitter is for) but whenever I can I try and follow a fair amount of original-content generators. &nbsp;In that regard, here are some of my absolute favorites:<br /><br />A recent discovery, no idea who this is but its a brilliant mixture of in-depth film reviews, linguistic research, and a bit of everything.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mstrmnd.com/log/" target="_blank">www.mstrmnd.com/log/</a><br /><br />Joan McNeill's thought experiment. &nbsp;Joanne has consistently had such an impressive and diverse social link I'm always surprised by the depth and variety across her blog, also for the Google Reader users, she is consistently sharing new/interesting stuff.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tomorrowmuseum.com" target="_blank">www.tomorrowmuseum.com</a><br /><br />Neuroscience and mindhacks, fantastic stuff.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mindhacks.com" target="_blank">www.mindhacks.com</a><br /><br />Klint Finley's excellent technology, weird science, and the occult blog. &nbsp;It's been around for a while and while this may be more my niche than most, he has consistently put out good content for ages<br /><br /><a href="http://www.technoccult.com" target="_blank">www.technoccult.com</a><br /><br />Rationality community blog, nuff said.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.lesswrong.com" target="_blank">www.lesswrong.com</a></p>
