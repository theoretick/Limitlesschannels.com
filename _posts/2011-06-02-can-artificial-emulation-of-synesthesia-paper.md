###Introduction###
The field of synesthesia in applications beyond a mere analysis of the condition has been largely unexplored, with only a few papers on the topic having been published within the last decade. The condition can potentially provide great benefits to the study of the psychology of language along with its role in language use itself.  As understanding of this condition continues to grow we can draw links between it and its effect on language use, thereby enabling a greater understanding of the language processing itself.  Synesthesia involves the stimulation of one sense along with involuntary activation of another sensory pathway. For those with synesthesia, 92% of cases are triggered via linguistic inducers, showing deep ties between the pathways used by the condition and those involved with language faculties (Barnett, 2009, p. 1343).  This paper will first cover synesthesia along with some of the many permutations the condition takes, then the previous research into the role of synesthesia in psycholinguistics including the subject of improved recall, next a framework for carrying out artificial simulation of the condition to improve participant's word recognition, and finally what could be done with the results gleaned.  The linking of sensory activation (or "cross talk" as it is commonly known) points to new understandings of how humans process information, especially language.  Research can also be applied in how those without the condition could hope to use similar techniques to facilitate visual word recognition.  

The role of synesthesia has not been adequately researched in its relation to lexical decision tasks.  It has been shown previously how effective synesthesia can be in informing cognitive research yet there is virtually no previous studies on application of synesthesia along with the possibility of artificial simulation (Kadosh, 2007).  This study will attempt to address this issue by simulating the condition through a period of training and through the results, providing a baseline for the work involved in future application of synesthesia to other areas.  

###Background###
Few researchers have previously linked the topic of synesthesia with psycholinguistic research and fewer still have tried to emulate the effects of the condition.  As one of the most fascinating and eye-opening phenomena of modern neuroscience, Synesthesia is a veritable treasure trove of data.  Synesthesia is the involuntary experience of one sense with the activation of another; this is automatic and reproducible within those diagnosed with the condition (Pearce, 2007, p. 120).  The condition has been linked to several other neurological conditions including eidetic memory and other cognitive effects.  According to Pearce (2007) in reference to the widely-cited paper on the subject by Baron-Cohen et al., the prevalence of the condition is close to 1 in 2,000 within the standard populace, however more recent research has shown the condition to be far more common.  Julia Simner (2006a), currently one of the most prolific researchers on the subject, has documented the condition as present in 1 in 23 of the population, or 4% (p. 23).  Due to the naturalness and-- in the majority of its forms-- lack of interference within daily activity, the condition often goes unnoticed for many years, making cataloging of its extent difficult to assess (Kadosh, 2007, p. 177).  Synesthesia manifests in a variety of ways including Number-Form Synesthesia involving spatial arrangement of numbers on a plane, Lexical-Gustatory Synesthesia involving spoken or written words triggering taste sensations,  Sound-Color Synesthesia involving experiences of color when hearing sounds, or even Ordinal Linguistic Personification involving assignment of entire distinct personalities to ordered sequences, such as days of the week.  It is well established that the cross-modal experience of synesthetes is bidirectional, as well, whereupon stimulus works in both directions with the triggering of senses (Pearce, 2007, p. 121) (Kadosh, 2007, p. 179) (Brang, 2010, p. 170).  

As one of the main areas of experimental research involved in synesthesia study, visual word recognition is an important factor.  This field covers the perception and processing involved in recognition of written word.  Visual Word Recognition (VWR) has been covered with a great deal of research yet there is still disagreement on several aspects of it, namely mechanisms.  The research previously has utilized a number of tools including eye-tracking and various kinds of lexical presentation tasks.  Two popular lexical tasks include naming tasks in which a participant must name the word presented and lexical-decision tasks in which a string of letters is shown and a participant must decide if they constitute a word (Harley, 2008, p. 170).  Both tasks involve several important aspects of VWR  demonstrated by using tools such as priming, where material is presented before the target stimulus to effect response, and masking, in which material is obscured to effect response.  In this study the lexical decision task will be administered in an attempt to see whether the structure of color-grapheme synesthesia facilitates VWR.  

####Synesthesia's Role in Cognitive Behavior####
In terms of the condition's effect on cognitive behavior, previous work has revealed synesthetes to have increased performance in visual search tasks as well as greater short-term and long-term recall.  Work involving synesthesia's role in memory has, however, been inconsistent and produced in several cases alternate results.  Research has tended to agree that synesthesia improves memory, yet the results have disagreed on the extent of memory improvement (Smilek, 2002) (Rothan, 2010).  Such previous work has in its scope pointed to significant improvements over standard cognitive abilities of nonsynesthetes.  Since synesthesia is not normally linked to any cognitive deficits, as mentioned above with the difficulty in identifying the condition's prevalence, it's role is unique in the positive benefits to several cognitive behaviors with no avert negative side-effects.  Synesthesia is thus a ripe candidate for emulation.  

For visual search tasks involving a grid of graphemes, Ramachandran and Hubbard (2001a) found performance of synesthetes to be significantly better at recognizing embedded variations on a grapheme-by-grapheme basis.  The researchers presented participants with a grid of randomly-placed '2's with embedded '5's in various shapes (such as a square) inside the grid.  Each grid was presented to the participants and the performance was measured, showing far better recognition in the groupings among synesthetes versus the non-synesthetes tested (p. 7).  In the same study in a second experiment the participants were tested with the "crowding effect."  Citing Bouma's work on the effect, Ramachandran and Hubbard describe it as the difficulty in identifying an individual grapheme when the target is closely flanked by other graphemes (p. 8).  While the effect was preserved in synesthetic subjects, they were still able to identify the obscured grapheme by its color response.  One participants stated 'I can't see that middle letter but it must be an "O" because it looks blue.' (p. 8).  The sensory response of synesthetes is then shown to facilitate recognition even under the circumstances of a participant facing visual obfuscation.  

Since Smilek's 2002 study demonstrating the extraordinary memory ability of a 21 year old participant, the idea of synesthesia's aid to memory has been widely cited (Simner, 2006a, p. 25).  The study describes the participant C's ability to memorize large quantities of numbers with a very low error rate, even reciting them back several months later with equivalent accuracy.  The effect is explained by C's description of her memorization process, involving her sensory experiences as a color-grapheme synesthete (p. 548).  Smilek describes previous papers linking the idea of memory and synesthesia including one of the earliest account in Luria's 1968 work on the mnemonist "S," for Shereshevsky.  Shereshevsky was noted for memorizing a 50-digit matrix in 3 minutes with perfect recall, yet Luria's study was rather problematic for its lack of empirical data (p. 548).  Smilek's analysis and presentation of 3 similar 50-digit matrices to participant C and 7 nonsynesthetic participants returned confirmatory results, whereupon C's performance with the black-digit matrix and the one congruent with her color associations showed superior recall to all 7 nonsynesthetic participants, yet her recall of the incongruently-colored matrix was incredibly poor at around 4%, compared to the nonsynesthetes who scored between 18 to 44% (p. 549).  

In contrast to Smilek's study, Rothan and Meier (2010) conducted a larger and more thorough group study of the memory abilities within a group of synesthetes.  The results of Rothan and Meier's research still showed a superior memory yet only an ordinary, as opposed to extraordinary, advantage (p. 258).  With analysis of 44 color-grapheme synesthetes Rothan and Meier found the average performance of participants to score above average in episodic memory tests and extraordinary in visual paired association learning tasks (p. 262).  While the results show superior episodic memory the results are still on average within range of above-average memory and not the extraordinary performance previously shown in research.  Furthermore, 3 of the 4 performed short-term memory tests yielded equal results to standard ranges (p. 263).  Rothan and Meier reason that the links between memory benefits and synesthesia are not directly related to presence of the condition but instead superior visual imaging abilities of synesthetes, but due to the isolated benefit, the condition only provides "islands of ability" (p. 263).  

####Color-Grapheme Synesthesia####
Of all varieties, the neurological condition manifests most commonly in what is known as Color-Grapheme Synesthesia, the subject of this study.  As previously shown, the prevalence of the condition within research demonstrates its prevalence and the close ties drawn to neurological ability.  This form causes synesthetes to associate individual graphemes with specific colors, often specific to shade or level of intensity such as the grapheme "b" presenting as vibrant blue.  While the biological conditions present to account for synesthesia are unclear, there has been some linkage to genes due to common appearance among family members (Pearce, 2007, p. 123).  Furthermore, due to extensive testing including various accounts of the condition's presence among the blind, synesthesia has been believed to be not merely a learned behavior through childhood but an inherent condition (Pearce, 2007, p. 124).  In one study however rather then dedicated neurological pathways, research by Ward (2006) using brain imagery has shown that the condition uses many of the same mechanisms involved in non-synesthetes' experience of cross-modal tasks, such as the McGurk Effect (p. 264).  This finding hints that further research may allow the effect to be similarly replicable within non-synesthetes.  Synesthesia then appears to fall closer to the category of a behavioral condition, rather than learned or strictly biological behavior.
Color-Grapheme synesthesia, as one of the more common types, has been the nexus of the majority of research into this field, explaining the close ties between orthographical presentation and cognitive processing.  This form of synesthesia is also one of the more thoroughly established as it remains consistent with previous psycholinguistic research and the established understanding of reading as involuntary and automatic, as demonstrated with such experiments as John Stroop's well-known Stroop Test (Harley, 2008, p. 178).  Research has also pointed to commonalities in color-grapheme synesthesia both in different speakers and in a speaker's own multilingualism.  In several cases there has been associations in bilingual speakers across different languages.  In one study conducted by Barnett, Feeney, Gormley, & Newell (2009) the analysis of a bilingual Russian-English synesthete showed commonalities within the lettering scheme between such graphemes as "R" and "?" (pronunciations corresponding to \[?] and \[ja], respectively), clearly demonstrating the associations in color-grapheme synesthesia are form-based rather than phonologically linked (p. 1344).  

Several studies have been conducted on those with the condition to measure responses to visual priming experiments.  In one such studies the participants were primed with contradictory pairings to their stated ones via prior collected data on the participants' associations.  In Brang, Edwards, Ramachandran, & Coulson's (2008) study on eight color-grapheme synesthetes the participants were primed with such phrases as "looking very clear, the lake was the most beautiful hue of...X" where X corresponds to the associated number or letter of the participant.  Responses to the stimuli were recorded via event-related brain potentials with congruous stimuli triggering less negative N400s in synesthetes in response to incongruous stimuli (p. 425).  One prompt, and the namesake of the paper, was the phrase "is the sky 2?" where congruity of one participant's association with 2 as blue produced agreeable responses to similar text-based response (p. 423).  While the control non-synesthetes experienced equal response to congruous and incongruous stimuli, the contextual response of the tested synesthetes points to a noticeable effect on VWR in modulating N400 spikes (p. 427).  

While previous studies have taken various looks at the effects of synesthesia on visual word recognition, little work has been done in its application.  One presentation during the proceedings of the 2005 International Symposium of Wearable Computers attempted artificial simulation, but the focus of their work was through computer hardware emulation with little regard for the linguistic aspects.  The study instead focused on performance in visual search tasks in terms of a proof of concept and while demonstrating some interesting results with the 8 participants showing an average 30.8% increase in recall as well as exhibiting all basic characteristics of non-emulated synesthesia (such as involuntary activation and stability of response over time), the experiment was insufficient in several ways (Plouznikoff, 2005). The demonstration was focused on the computer science and engineering aspects, lacked a cognitive component, and was also somewhat deficient in terms of true scientific rigor.  However, in light of the results and with previous research on synesthesia in mind, the work showed promise and justification in pursuing further testing on the subject, specifically in regards to the linguistic applications.  

###Rationale###
This study will attempt to answer one key question:  

Does artificial grapheme-color association aid non-synesthetes in recognition tasks?  

As previously shown, much research on synesthesia has shown greater recognition and recall skills among synesthetes.  Whether these cognitive benefits are results of synesthesia or are only correlations has not been established.  In this study by emulating synesthetic association we will be attempting to replicate the cognitive effects such as improved facilitation in nonsynesthetes.  

With confirmation of our initial hypothesis, the benefits of synesthetic emulation can be applied to a variety of fields, including education and other areas that would greatly benefit from increased visual word recognition.  In terms of the psychology of language it would more clearly connect the fields of cross-modal interaction and visual search to the role of color in such psycholinguistic tasks as form-based priming, neighborhood effects, and attentionality in processing (such as the mandatory aspects of reading).  

With refutation of our initial hypothesis, it could be gleaned from the research that the cognitive benefits commonly seen with synesthetes are not directly connected to associative color-grapheme recognition, but perhaps another factor.  Refutation of the hypothesis would also show a disconnect between facilitation of word recognition and visual search tasks, leading to evidence against certain cross-modal interactions.  

###Method and Design###
In light of research on synesthesia's role in aiding retrieval, this study will utilize the data that has been collected on consistencies in Color-Grapheme Synesthesia in different participants and identify the most commonly linked colors with their graphemes.  Lexical decision tasks will be conducted first without modification and later, after visual training, again with grapheme coloring added according to the commonality data.  The results of the two separate tests will be compared using a standard t-test and should demonstrate whether or not artificial simulation of synesthetic effects improves visual word recognition in tasks.  

As previously mentioned, certain commonalities in synesthetic color-grapheme associations have been shown across multiple synesthetes.  In Simner's (2006a) work on color-grapheme synesthesia and association trends, the use of statistical and linguistic analysis enabled her to note three general themes: (a) high-frequency colors tend to pair with high-frequency graphemes, (b) associations tend to follow initial letter priming in words (i.e. 'r' pairs with "red"), and (c) pairing of high-frequency letters and lower numbers tend to follow the established typology of color words that arise in languages with few to greater color terms (p. 25).  In a previous study, Simner et al. (2005) were able to collect data and test the responses of 70 native English-speaking synesthetes.  Using the data coalesced from Simner et al.'s (2005) research, the "prototypical" synesthetic alphabet (Figure 1) will become the basis for emulation within participants.  The data does however present a few problems such as the lack of representation for the letter "k."  In the study, participants felt no strong color association with the letter.  In this case we assigned "k" the default shade of black.

####Participants####
An adequate sample of individuals for this study should be between 20 to 30 healthy adults who speak English natively.  This would include a distribution of adult males and females dependent on available participants.  The group would be of a varied age, ethnicity, and economic status to be representative of the standard population.  Since the test will be conducted using a written text and a computer program requiring some interaction, the participants will be required to have some basic computer proficiency and high school graduate level literacy skills.
All participants required for this study will be carefully screened to prevent any predilection toward any synesthetic condition.  Participants will be briefed on the condition with presentation of data on the ways in which synesthesia can manifest and asked if they have or currently experience any form of synesthesia and, if so, which they believe they may have.  Any kind of affirmatory response will cause the participants to be excluded from the study.  

The selected participants will be randomly divided into two groups, with one as the experimental group and the other designated as the control.  The participants will not be told to which of these groups they belong.  The experimental group will undergo the synesthetic training process between testing while the control group will be used as a comparative baseline to measure the results of the training on the experimental group.  

####Design####
	Once participants are selected and divided into the two groups, each will both perform a lexical decision task.  This test will be administered via computer with each participant being placed before the program and with the presentation of each lexical item told to respond in one of two ways: by pressing the "Yes Button" if the string of graphemes presented on the screen form a word, or pressing the "No Button" if the string of graphemes presented do not form a known word.  The testing will be conducted on an individual basis with the participants asked to indicate their decision as quickly as possible.  For the two different rounds of testing, a 72 word corpus of 36 non-words and 36 words will be prepared, randomized and divided into two data sets, the first data set to be administered initially to both participant groups and the second data set to be administered after synesthetic association training.  The response time (RT) for each lexical decision task response will be measured and recorded for analysis.  The first test will be conducted, the participants then sent home after, and the next test conducted approximately one week later.  

Between the first and second lexical decision testing there will be a period of training for the group that will undergo synesthetic emulation.  This group will be presented with a prepared collection of newspaper articles to read in which the text provided is colored on a grapheme by grapheme basis according to Simner et al.'s (2005) collected frequency data.  Similarly, the control group will be given the same text, but with no coloring.  Each participant will be told to read one of the articles, spacing them one a day during the week before they are to return for the follow-up testing.  The secondary lexical decision task will be conducted in an identical manner to the first lexical decision task, but using the second grouping of words from the 72 word data set, to prevent repetition of any remembered response.  

###Analysis###
	The data gathered from the initial lexical decision task and the secondary task will be used to measure the effect of the synesthetic training process.  The non-synesthetically trained group data will act as a control to measure the synesthetically trained group to show any standard deviations that could result were the secondary round of testing to vary from the initial for any reason.  If in the secondary testing participants were to average significantly lower or higher rates of facilitation then this data could be used to adjust the results of both groups accordingly.  

The data between the two groups will be compared to confirm the initial hypothesis and determine if the group which underwent synesthetic emulation shows significant improvements  in performance over untrained visual word recognition.  A standard t-test will be performed to measure differences between the sets and determine if there is any increase in facilitation speed due to the synesthetic training.  If there is no significant difference after adjustment of the data with the control group for standard deviation then the initial hypothesis will be refuted.  

###Conclusion###
	In light of the experiments results, the strides within the fields of both psychology of language and psychology itself would be put in a striking new light.  With the previous research on synesthetic application being rather insufficient, this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the cross-modal interactions involved in visual word recognition and the process involved in word recognition, as well.  The connection between linguistic inducers and synesthetic response is already well-established yet the extent of that connection has not yet been fully explored, as would be pursued within this research.  Furthermore, with the results of the experiment the application of synesthetic effect to other fields involved in reading and comprehension are widespread and go beyond an understanding of cognitive processing to a variety of additional research areas.  Synesthesia is a fascinating condition with huge potential and with this research comes the first step in opening the doors to a greater psychological and physiological understanding of the brain and the mechanism of language within it.
