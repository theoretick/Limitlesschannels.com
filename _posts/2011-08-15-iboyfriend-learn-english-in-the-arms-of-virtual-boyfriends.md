<p>Amazing new Japanese iPhone app for learning English:</p>

<p><em>This application, as you might have guessed, is a novel new twist on foreign language &lsquo;edutainment&rsquo;. Consumers begin a virtual relationship with one of three characters, and as their romantic love story unfolds, English conversational ability is apparently enhanced! Wow!</em></p>
