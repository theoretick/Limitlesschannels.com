<p>from University of Texas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;ADHD is not about inattention,&rdquo; Gilden says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disorder in the way people thread moment-to-moment experiences together. Children with ADHD are often disruptive because their world is moving at a much faster pace and there&rsquo;s always going to be a mismatch between their world and ours.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>As part of his research, Gilden measured how people with and without the disorder tap along to the beat of a metronome. The respondents then continue tapping at the same pace for three minutes after the metronome stops. Although both groups were able to tap to the beat at 60 beats per minute, the participants with ADHD lost the rhythm when the tempo slowed down to 40 beats per minute.</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The slower the tempo, the more likely people with ADHD will be less internally consistent with themselves,&rdquo; Gilden says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re inattentive, it&rsquo;s just that their world is moving along at a slightly faster clip.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>...Gilden says&nbsp;<strong>&ldquo;This is a very puzzling discovery because although their minds are moving at a faster rate, they&rsquo;re actions are more spacious.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
