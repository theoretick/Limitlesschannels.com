<p>NewYorkTimes.com has a built-in dictionary where readers can instantly look up any word that is used in an article. NYT keeps track of this data and has recently published this year's "Most frequently looked-up words" list.</p>

<br />
<p>Meanwhile, I've been reading Ulysses and picked up half a dozen more, have at thee:</p>
<p><strong>consubstantial </strong>- Of the same substance or essence (used esp. of the three persons of the Trinity in Christian theology)</p>
<p><strong>coign </strong>- A projecting corner or angle of a wall or building.</p>
<p><strong>moiety </strong>- Each of two parts into which a thing is or can be divided.</p>
<p><strong>postprandial </strong>- During or relating to the period after dinner or lunch.</p>
<p><strong>jakes </strong>- toilet, esp. an outdoor one</p>
<p><strong>offal </strong>- The entrails and internal organs of an animal used as food.</p>
<p><strong>cad </strong>- A man who behaves dishonorably, esp. toward a woman.</p>
<br />
<p>Just like everything else I try to learn I've compiled these into a convenient deck to be used in Anki, which you can grab <a href="/storage/ankidecks/NYTandUlyssesVocab.anki">HERE</a>.  I would however recommend that anyone with the time actually enter these manually since the process of inputting them actually does contribute to memorization.</p>
