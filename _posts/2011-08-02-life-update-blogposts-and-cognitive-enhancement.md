<p>So I've decided to start getting more serious and frequent on this blog. &nbsp;I'll be trying a daily blogging experiment today that I'll be extending for the next two months, or as far as I can actually keep this up. &nbsp;We'll see.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, today is the second day of my two month nootropics/cognitive-training regiment. &nbsp;I've had an interest in smart drugs (often called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropics" target="_blank">nootropics</a>) for quite some time now and while I've played with them in the past, any experiments I've done have lacked in some serious scientific rigor. &nbsp;So, starting yesterday I've mapped out the next two months with twice daily doses of nootropics, once a day general vitamins, and some nice spreadsheet-directed cataloguing. &nbsp;I should be posting some kind of updates in the next few weeks but if not I'll definitely have some nice data by the end of my session to post.</p>
<p>Each day I'll be cataloguing sleep, mood, energy, and exercise on a scale of 0 to 5 as well as participating in 20 daily <a href="http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">N-Back</a> sessions and using my long-time friend <a href="http://ichi2.net/anki" target="_blank">Anki</a> for spaced-repetition memory testing. &nbsp;N-Back research has pointed to near linear improvement so significant improvement via the noots should increase the slope by N factors, whatever that may be. &nbsp;Color me hopeful but skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>Daily:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multivitamin</li>
<li>B Complex</li>
<li>DHA</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Twice daily:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Piracetam 800mg</li>
<li>Choline 500mg</li>
<li>Vinpocetine 10mg</li>
<li>Huperzine 200mcg</li>
<li>DMAE (and later) ALCAR</li>
</ul>
<p>Further information on any of the above can be found below, or go ahead and email/tweet me:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ" target="_blank">Gwern's excellent, lengthy N-Back information page</a></p>
<p>Regarding Anki, more information can be found on their site or on Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">Spaced Repetition article</a>&nbsp;and on <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/language/srs.php" target="_blank">Omniglot's site</a> which has a nice collection of the different available types.</p>
<p>Legit information on nootropics is widespread and hard to coalesce but <a href="http://www.longecity.org/forum/topic/36691-ten-months-of-research-condensed-a-total-newbies-guide-to-nootropics/" target="_blank">here's a fairly anecdotal and well-cited forum post</a> that is honestly one of the better collected information sources I've found. &nbsp;Otherwise, feel free to pick up the classic (and again rather outdated) text <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Drugs-Nutrients-Intelligence-Neuroscience/dp/0941683249/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312331116&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank">Smart Drugs by Ward Dean</a>.</p>

<p>Found this post to be pretty inspiring, mostly cause it seems to be a nice MED for cognitive enhancement. Will you be putting up more info on how it ended up? I got the Ngyuen N-Back app and it is quite nice. Is there any way to get a copy of  the blank spreadsheet you used how you tracked everything? Thank you!</p>
