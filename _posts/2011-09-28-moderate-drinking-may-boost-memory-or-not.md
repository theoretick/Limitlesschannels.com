<p>Been doing a bit too much studying and homework paired with a beer or a finger of whiskey lately. &nbsp;Anyway, i let my confirmation bias take over and find some research to back up my overindulgence and located this. &nbsp;Whoo...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ohio State University has some research posted on how <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/alzhalco.htm" target="_blank">Alcohol can actually end up boosting memory</a>. &nbsp;Specifically those who drink to block out memories may actually be further solidifying them with heavy drinking. &nbsp;Neat/sad stuff.</p>
<p>Just as easily, i ran a quick search and found completely conflicting results along with all kinds of other stuff over onthe Wikipedia page <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-term_effects_of_alcohol" target="_blank">Short-Term Effects of Alcohol</a>&nbsp;and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_memory" target="_blank">Effects of Alcohol on Memory</a>. &nbsp;So... nothing new in the world of research.</p>
