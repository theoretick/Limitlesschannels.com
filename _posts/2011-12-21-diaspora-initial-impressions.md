description: first impressions of social network Diaspora

<div>So I finally joined Diaspora. &nbsp;The invitation has been sitting in my inbox for a good month or so and having lost interest within the months of their glacial development pace, I simply had no interest. &nbsp;Having a bit of spare time today and feeling like a testing mood, I tried it out. &nbsp;Here's some impressions:</div>
<br />
<h2>First Impressions:</h2>
<div>Diaspora appears to be just a blatant blend of Twitter and Google+. &nbsp;It is basically just twitter's hashtags and @mentions (both directly called such) plus circles. &nbsp;The irony is that it really makes for a great experience. &nbsp;I've been saying since G+'s launch that there is a strong need for metadata. &nbsp;My "Android Developer" circle on G+ frankly sucks since I could care less about the developer's lives and merely want updates on my latest roms and software. &nbsp;The issue is that the only differentiation is by users, not users' posts. &nbsp;Hashtags were recently added, yes, but until everyone is volitionally&nbsp;labeling&nbsp;things or it's built-in, it's damn near useless.</div>
<br />
<div>But back to Diaspora. &nbsp;Ringing in yet another twitter comparison, or perhaps social networking in general, it has that distinctive shouting-into-the-void feel to it. &nbsp;While nice for sharing myself, it's less nice for getting feedback. &nbsp;The interface is clean and quite minimal, the post groups (i.e. Google+ Circles) are called "aspects" which I rather like. &nbsp;Diaspora seems to takes a more humanist approach to Google's (perpetually engineer-based and blunt) venn diagram joke.</div>
<br />
<div>As far as I can tell, I cannot import my Twitter friends, which is if nothing else annoying. &nbsp;Facebook importing seems to work, which found all three of my friends also on Diaspora. &nbsp;A couple hashtag interest searches have netted me people to follow yet in terms of stream quality at the moment, its visually pleasing, utility light. &nbsp;Lots of art sharing, little news sharing. &nbsp;I have never been big on finding the pretty things on the internet so until some better info sources find their way onto Diaspora, I won't be visiting for my daily dose.</div>
<br />
<div>Diaspora is well-constructed and could be potentially awesome. &nbsp;Unfortunately, its pretty late to the game and if its one strength over Google+ (metadata posts) makes it over to Google, I won't have much purpose hanging around.</div>
<div></div>
