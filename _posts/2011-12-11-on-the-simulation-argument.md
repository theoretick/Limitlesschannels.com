<div>I have been thinking about the <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">Simulation Argument</a> lately.  Philosopher Nick Bostrom's Simulation Argument more or less works like this, by first agreeing that one of the following is true:</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a &ldquo;posthuman&rdquo; stage</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof)</div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation</div>

<p>The argument from there (because rejecting all is not entirely reasonable) follows if (1) or (2) are the case then we simply do not have to think about it, and thus dismiss the argument. &nbsp;The strength here is that there is no theoretical limitation that would prevent us from achieving such simulations. &nbsp;And once we have the technological ability, why not run thousands upon thousands of simulations at once for scientific purposes or mere curiosity. &nbsp;If (3) is the case, then upon realization it may&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;alter are view and experience of everyday behavior. &nbsp;By guessing or determining the belief structure of the simulator one can target or anticipate the effect of specific behavior, whereupon an assumption of the ruleset allows one to "win." &nbsp;This could include something like fulfilling karma-rich dharma behavior to assure one's acceptance into the oneness that is Brahman afterlife.</p>

<p>What I have been considering though is why the conclusion favors advanced civilizations running simulations of past history. &nbsp;I would assume that any advanced civilization would retain the same goals as the present one, attempting to predict the future. &nbsp;My issue here is the premise that we would use our technology to be reflective, when it would seem more practical to run simulations beginning with the present state and determine the results of the immediate future. &nbsp;The end goal of the simulation argument [and that is assuming one accepts premise (3)] is that probablistically we are living in a simulation right now. &nbsp;While that may be true assuming an advanced civilization would be running historical simulations I would assume that the civilization would run future ones. &nbsp;Since at present we do not have the technology to do this, it cannot be a future simulation and therefore we must not be in a computer simulation.</p>
