description: Notes gathered from Sam Harris' personal blog on violence and BJJ
---

Recently Sam Harris had two interesting blogposts on self-defense and violence.  While each goes a different way with some recent interests he has had I found them both riddled with some excellent rules, tidbits, and affirmations.

##The Truth about Violence##

It may seem onerous to prepare yourself and your family to respond to violence, but not doing so is also a form of preparation. Failing to prepare is, generally speaking, preparing very well to do the wrong thing.

The role of the police is to respond in the aftermath of a crime

###Principle #1: Avoid dangerous people and dangerous places.###

Learn to recognize and shun status-seeking displays of aggression.
As a matter of law, the moment you engage in avoidable violence of this kind—rising to a challenge and escalating the conflict—you lose any legal claim to self-defense.
--- Self-defense is not about winning fights with aggressive men who probably have less to lose than you do.
---  You do not know who you are talking to—and you don’t know if he is armed.
--- Never threaten your opponent.
 Reach for a weapon only if you are prepared to use it and believe you would be justified in doing so.
**De-escalate and move on:**

**“What are you looking at, asshole?”**

**“Sorry, man. I was just spacing out. It’s been a long day.”**

You should also learn to trust your feelings of apprehension about other people—revising them only slowly and with good reason.

###Principle #2: Do not defend your property.###

You should view any invitation to violence as an opportunity to die—or to be sent to prison for killing another human being. Violence must truly be the last resort.

###Principle #3: Respond immediately and escape.###

Do whatever you can to avoid a physical confrontation, but the moment avoidance fails, attack explosively for the purposes of escape

Your goal is to get away with minimum trauma (to you), while harming your attacker in any way that seems necessary to ensure your escape

The moment it is clear that an assailant wants more than your property (which must be assumed in any home invasion), you must escape.

you do not need to learn hundreds of techniques to become proficient in the physical aspects of self-defense. Rather, you should train a small number of skills nearly to the point of reflex.

##Pleasures of Drowning##

Delusions of martial prowess have much in common with religious faith. A crucial difference, however, is that while people of faith can always rationalize apparent contradictions between their beliefs and the data of their senses, an inability to fight is very easy to detect and, once revealed, very difficult to explain away.

Most students of the martial arts have been aware of BJJ for years—since its emergence in the Ultimate Fighting Championship in 1993. The UFC was the first series of “mixed martial arts” (MMA) tournaments to get serious attention. The great novelty of these events is that they allow any style of fighting to be pitted against any other. Combatants from all disciplines—karate, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, muay Thai, kung fu, judo, tai kwon do, sambo, kickboxing, sumo, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, etc.—are simply placed in a ring (or, at the UFC, in an octagonal cage) in pairs. In the first years of the UFC, there were no weight divisions, rounds, or time limits and very few rules. In fact, there were no judges, because every fight ended by knockout, submission, referee stoppage, or a fighter’s corner throwing in the towel.

Many people found the resulting spectacle horrifying—a modern version of the Roman games. But to the martial arts community the first UFC events were a science experiment that had been centuries in the making: Finally, there would be an answer to the one question of perennial interest to fighters everywhere: “What is the best method of fighting?” After a few hours, the answer seemed clear—and it wasn’t boxing, wrestling, karate, or kung fu. Whatever a man’s size, strength, skill, and prior training, a relatively diminutive practitioner of BJJ, Royce Gracie, could completely dominate him.

“What is the best method of fighting?”, and all MMA fighters now do their best to embody it:
When you are standing at arm’s length from your opponent, you want to be able to punch like a Western-style boxer and kick like a Thai boxer.

Moving closer, you want to remain a Thai boxer in your ability to strike with your knees and elbows.

Once your opponent grabs hold of you, or you him (the clinch), you want to have the skills of a Greco-Roman/freestyle wrestler—controlling his posture and throwing him to the ground at will. In the presence of sufficient clothing (jackets, coats, or traditional martial arts uniforms), this vertical grappling can take the form of judo. The general picture at this range is of two people being too close to strike one another effectively: You want to be the one who can move the fight to the ground on his own terms—by executing takedowns or throws—and who can resist being taken there.

And if the fight goes to the ground, the surest path to the safety of home remains Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The original revelation of the UFC still stands—with the coda that since everyone has now learned the same skills, an ability to strike on the ground has grown more important in MMA. Whether one practices BJJ by name doesn’t necessarily matter, because other arts teach similar techniques—submission wrestling, sambo, etc. But no other discipline has mapped the frontiers of ground fighting the way BJJ has.

To spend years perfecting the art of ground fighting is to risk forgetting that if a fight starts, the last place you want to be is on the ground.

###and a nice comment by one of the best BJJ practitioners around###

Matt Thornton writes: I agree we need all three ranges—stand up, clinch and ground—for self-defense; and, in general, we want to avoid going to the ground in a fight. However, the best way to ensure that you will end up on the ground is to never train there in the first place. It’s the non-grapplers who are easiest to take down, and being in a “fight” means it isn’t necessarily up to you where you end up. So, it’s a bit of irony that wanting to stay off the ground in a self-defense situation should dictate a serious commitment to grappling.
