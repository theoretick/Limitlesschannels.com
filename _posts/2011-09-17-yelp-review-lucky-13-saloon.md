description: My yelp review of Lucky 13 Saloon in Brooklyn, NY
---

<p>It was such a kickass experience I've since posted this to Yelp but straight out of my journal on my recent voyage to NYC. &nbsp;Sorry if it's all "reviewy" in style but that's kind of the point, catering to a crowd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I wanted to grab a drink after work with a friend before we headed home and he tattooed me (that's right) so we stopped in at a bar that we had heard about when another coworker said "they play weird shit on TV like castration films and stuff." &nbsp;Well, we were sold.<br /><br />We arrived, got some beers (IPA!) and admired the sweet Babes in Toyland and metal paraphernalia around. &nbsp;A few minutes in our bartender was up on the bar dancing on the pole and kicking music's ass. &nbsp;When she got down the spot was quickly taken up by another patron and the night was on. &nbsp;The bartender asked us if we had ever been there before and we said we hadn't so she gave us the rundown. &nbsp;Tonight was tuesday, that meant it was DJ and go-go dancer night! &nbsp;That's tuesdays and thursdays, btw. &nbsp;In little under an hour the DJ and three dancers would stop by and make our evening killer. &nbsp;Running a quick bit of arithmetic at the current rate that would outnumber the actual customers, but hey, this is the place that &nbsp;brings its own party. &nbsp;Furthermore the Troma (or is it Fullmoon?) classic Poultrygeist was on the TV and the violent satanic chicken battle offered perfect backdrop to the night. &nbsp;It was also a couple people's birthdays that night so our bartender presented the skeleton beer bong to us soon to be filled, then refilled, then refilled some more.<br /><br />I was pretty damn pissed when I had to go home after one beer and get some ink but damned if it wasn't the marker for exactly why I need to visit NYC more often. &nbsp;And next time, it sure as hell will be my birthday.</p>
