description: comparison of the eight main and currently available Android N-Back apps

<p style="text-align: center;"><em style="font-size: 90%;">My previous article describes N-Back a bit better for those who missed it or are interested: <a href="http://bit.ly/r6g9r7" target="_blank">What Exactly is N-Back?</a></em></p>

<p><em>Current as of 9 April 2012: Added reviews of "N-Back Maestro" and "Single N-Back"</em></p>

<p><strong>Bit of Background</strong>: Now that I've finally started putting in daily N-Back sessions and just like the rest of my life, I've been slowly converting everything to mobile so I can handle all my tasks away from a computer. &nbsp;Best case scenario I find a universally-compatible program with a desktop and mobile component. &nbsp;While that part is still severely lacking (nothing here has a desktop equivalent) there are some rough hacks involving dropbox that I have been working on. &nbsp;Until I perfect that script anyway, I will stick entirely to my Android phone. &nbsp;Which app is the best? &nbsp;Well as of August 10th, I've tried all the dedicated ones and even the paid ones. So, on to the comparison.</p>
<br />

<p>There are currently 8 main candidates in the app market: Quazar's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=quazar.BrainNBack" target="_blank">Brain N Back</a>, Nguyen's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnback" target="_blank">Brain N-Back</a>, Polytech's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Projet4A.DualNBack" target="_blank">DualNBack</a>, and Piotr's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.wie.p.nback" target="_blank">N-Back</a>.  Given the complete lack of creative naming this review might get absurdly confusing, so I'll try and use the author's name for these.  Oh, also there's <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=waterdev.NBack" target="_blank">Waterdev's NBack</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_viana_octavio.IQ_Boost" target="_blank">IQBoost</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.urbian.android.games.nback" target="_blank">N-Back Maestro</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ankerl.singlenback" target="_blank">Single N-Back</a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">but since I'm a cheap bastard right now, I haven't quite gone out and bought this these</span> since I wasn't super satisfied with all the other offerings, I decided to try out these other four, as well.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: 90%;"><em>A note on feedback: I think the feedback feature can be detrimental to the exercise since it is too easy to get caught up mid-task and analyze one's correct or incorrect move, affecting the spontanaeity and focus of the exercise. Feedback can be useful occasionally for "calibrating" oneself to the new N- turn variable, but otherwise I believe should be avoided, hence I do not tend to mention it as a feature here.</em></span></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quazar's Brain N Back (free):</span></strong></p>
<p>Quazar's app is about as bare-bones as you can get, it's for doing N-Backs and that's about it.</p>
<div></div>

<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>+ Choice of Single, Dual, or Triple N-Back</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>- No statistics</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>- No resuming</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>- Not super aesthetically pleasing</p>
<p><strong>Rating:<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>4 / 10</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>


<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nguyen's Brain N-Back<strong> (free or donated)</strong></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Solid app with all the core features (statistics and variable stimulus; i.e. position, color, and shape) with no major issues in terms of stability.  After a week of use it didn't crash once.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnback" target="_blank"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/images/nback/Nguyen.png" alt="Nguyen's Brain N-Back" /></a></span></span></p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>+ Stable and Pretty</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>+ Both daily and overrall statistics</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>- <strong><em>Detailed</em></strong> daily statistics only, not overrall statistics or ability to reference old days individually</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"></span>- Fewer settings; i.e. No session limit per day</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Ads. &nbsp;But removable with premium version</p>
<p><strong>Rating:<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>8 / 10</strong></p>
<p>** Interesting feature note: Audio stimulus can be changed from letters to piano notes!</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Polytech Marseille's DualNBack (free):</span></strong></p>
<p> As the name states, this is for purely <em>Dual</em> N-Back.  That being said, there's still N- adjustment and a clean interface for getting it done.  Unfortunately, the recorded audio-letter stimulus is so horrible I can't legitimately tell if it is French or English; I only say French due to the app's name.</p>
<div></div>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Projet4A.DualNBack" target="_blank"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/images/nback/polytechmarseille.png" alt="Polytech's DualNBack" /></a></span></p>
<p> + Clean Interface</p>
<p> + Easy N- adjustment (cool little side buttons)</p>
<p> - Virtually no adjustment otherwise (stimulus, sessions, orientation, etc.)</p>
<p> - No statistics</p>
<p><strong> Rating: 3 / 10</strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Piotr's N-Back (free):</span></strong></p>
<p>This one was interesting, given the less then detailed explanation in the market I assumed it to be fairly minimal like Quazar's but Piotr's actually has some of the best settings of any of the apps. In my brief testing it was stable, however the audio was not very clear and the control scheme was a mess on my 4.3" screen. One review said it was designed for the Nexus One (4" screen, so perhaps that is the issue).</p>
<div></div>
<p><strong><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.wie.p.nback" target="_blank"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/images/nback/Piotr.png" alt="Piotr's NBack" /></a></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;+ Most extensive feature set I've seen so far; number of sessions, % to advance, starting N-, feedback</p>
<p>&nbsp;+ Variety of stimulus</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Somewhat confusing controls</p>
<p> - Unpolished interface</p>
<p> - Can't tell if the statistics are actually working...</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 7 / 10</strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">N-Back Maestro ($1.99):</span></strong></p>
<p> N-Back Maestro is the newest entry into the market and a rather nice little app.  It features preset "tiers" to try and some beautiful graphs and interface to show you display your data.  The app uses a split-screen of two tiles and is entirely visual, allowing for either position or letter, but not on the same display.  This makes it a bit hard to follow since it requires you to rapidly glance between two displays, feeling more like an eye exercise than a cognitive one.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.urbian.android.games.nback" target="_blank"><img style="width:150px;" src="/images/nback/nbackmaestro.png" alt="N-Back Maestro" /></a></span></p>
<p> + Attractive and clean interface</p>
<p> + Preset programs are handy</p>
<p> + Graphs and stats on your progress</p>
<p> + Ability to make customized routines</p>
<p> - Visual only, no audio</p>
<p> - Split-screen tiles seem like a bad approach</p>
<p> - Instant feedback is good for testing but too distracting </p>
<p><strong>Rating: 7 / 10</strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Waterdev's NBack ($1.50):</span></strong></p>
<p> For one of the only current paid N-Back apps, I had high hopes for Waterdev and while it is indeed quite polished with more then the minimal options of other ones it still has a limited feature set. Feature-wise it may be a bit lacking but as stated for the aesthetically-inclined, this is the clear winner.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=waterdev.NBack" target="_blank"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/images/nback/Waterdev.png" alt="Waterdev's N-Back" /></a></span></p>
<p> + Beautiful and Stable</p>
<p> + Ability to set different profiles</p>
<p> + Statistics (overall only)</p>
<p> - Doesn't inhibit lockscreen, which may turn on mid-game and void current round.  This can be a real deal-breaker</p>
<p> - Limited feature set</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 6 / 10</strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Single N-Back (free):</a></span></strong></p>
<p> One of the simplest of all apps.  Only for single N-back and limited purely to numeric stimulus.  Quick N-switching and even a few minimum settings.  Simplicity isn't too admirable however when it is really just a lack of features.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ankerl.singlenback" target="_blank"><img style="width:150px;" src="/images/nback/singlenback.png" alt="Single N-Back" /></a></span></p>
<p> + Simplicity</p>
<p> + Some customization (N, game length, and speed)</p>
<p> - Limited to single only</p>
<p> - No stats </p>
<p><strong>Rating: 3 / 10</strong></p>
<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IQ Boost (free or $1.00):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Here's the other paid N-back in the market, nearly brand new having been posted only two weeks ago. IQBoost is a iOS port that has finally made it to Android. The interface is well constructed with quality sound and graphics, yet it has only a few options for defining task.</strong></p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-left ssNonEditable"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_viana_octavio.IQ_Boost" target="_blank"><img style="width: 150px;" src="/images/nback/IQBoost.png" alt="IQ Boost" /></a></span></p>
<p> + Variable stimulus; either sound, spatial, or both</p>
<p> - Only single or dual N-back possible</p>
<p> - Unique style. Audio stimulus uses farm animals rather than letters or numbers</p>
<p> + Allows for variable duration, which may or may not actually be useful</p>
<p> - Statistics?</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 5 / 10</strong></p>
<p>** Interesting feature note: IQ Boost also comes in a "boys name version" and "girls name version." &nbsp;No idea what that is and there's no description.</p>

<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Winner:</span></strong></p>
<p>Piotr's NBack clearly has the best feature set and options that I really want in an app, yet awkward layout (at least for my 4.3" screen) and while it has most of what I'm looking for, one other seems to bring it all together in the most packaged and balanced way, so without further ado:</p>
<p><strong>Nguyen's N-Back!</strong></p>
<p>While there are a couple features still lacking, Nguyen's still had the greatest balance of features with the right amount of interface polish. While it still lacks some certain features, Nguyen appears to be a pretty great dev who responds to all requests, so I'll be submitting my desired features and we shall see if we can't make the best on so far a bit better. Meanwhile, if you feel like supporting him, there's a <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="https://market.android.com/details?id=phuc.entertainment.dualnbackpremium&amp;feature=search_result" target="_blank">"premium" ad-free version on the market</a>.</p>
<p>I'm still not entirely satisfied with the apps available right now, so until I get a few more features or stability in each, I'll be sticking with Nguyen's.</p>
<p><strong>Things I still want:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exporting</strong> (if any did have this then I would have just posted my own N-Back daily sessions here in some nice data-aggregating fashion)</li>
<li><strong>Better statistics</strong>, that is the ability to review previous days in detail</li>
<li><strong>Session limits for the day</strong>, i.e. stopping at 20 rather than infinite regression</li>
</ul>
