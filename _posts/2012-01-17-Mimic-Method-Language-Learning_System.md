Description: New language learning system developed to perfect pronunciation and accent acquisition
---
While reading Metafilter I stumbled on a new language learning system developed by Idahosa Ness called the Mimic Method.  In the perpetual attempt to perfect pronunciation and accent acquisition, this method focuses on mimicry to achieve accurate pronunciation and reproduction.  It is actually not far off from the method children use during language acquisition (see fixed forms and derived forms in child speech).  [It's in beta right now](http://www.mimicmethod.com/about.html), but feel free to sign up.  Once I get in I'll report back with some tidbits and first impressions.
