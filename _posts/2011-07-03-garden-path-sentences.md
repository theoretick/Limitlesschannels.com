<p>Garden Path Sentences are some of the more interesting cognitive linguistic tools that give us some clever insight into how our minds process syntax. &nbsp;A Garden Path sentence involves an initial (incorrect) reading of the phrase and a subsequent rereading for the correct meaning. &nbsp;The basic idea is that we process sentences on the fly and bi-directionally. &nbsp;Without delving too deeply into models of visual word processing and how we read, there are several fascinating insights into the way this works, but for brevity sake I'll just give some examples. &nbsp;The sentences are first read through sequentially from left to right but upon reaching the end of the phrase in confusion, the eyes of the reader will jump back and forth in a reinterpretation of the sentence to find the true meaning.</p>
<p>Before reading the intepretations try and figure out the meaning of the sentences yourself:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;"The old man the boat."&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Intepretation One: <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The old man]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [the boat]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span></em>." two sequential noun phrases (NPs) with no perceivable verb.</span></p>
<p>Interpretation Two (post restructuring): <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The old]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span>&nbsp;[man]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">VERB</span>&nbsp;[the boat]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP.</span></em>" &nbsp;After the first reading "man" is revealed to be the verb, not part of the subject noun phrase.</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">Or my favorite and perhaps the best well-known:</p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;"The horse raced past the barn fell"</li>
</ul>
<p>Interpretation One: <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The horse]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [raced]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">V</span> [past]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">AD</span><span style="vertical-align: sub;">V</span> [the barn]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span>&nbsp;[fell]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">???</span>.</em>" Here the reader will first read it as a complete sentence with a stranded verb "fell."</span></p>
<p>Interpretation Two (post restructuring): <span style="background-color: #000; color: #000;" onmouseover="this.style.color='#FFF';" onmouseout="this.style.color=this.style.backgroundColor='#000';">"<em>[The horse raced past the barn]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">NP</span> [fell]<span style="vertical-align: sub;">VERB</span>.</em>" Where everything but the verb "fell" is part of the subject noun phrase. &nbsp;In this case the horse <strong>is being raced</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="vertical-align: sub;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Here, while both are correct a clarification for the sentences ambiguity could be rephrasing the sentence as "The horse <strong>that was </strong>raced past the barn fell"</p>
