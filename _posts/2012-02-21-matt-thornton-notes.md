###PHIL320U - Guest Lecture with Matt Thornton###
From Pete Boghossian's "Critical Thinking" course
Week 7 - "don't believe your eyes"
21feb2011
-----

functional "delivery systems" preferrable to "styles"

To assess a martial art look at how they train. Watch attacker, not defender
note: absence of resisting opponent

**3 Criteria to self-defense**
standup (strikes) -- muaythai/boxing
clinch -- wrestling
ground -- BJJ

use the minimum amount of effort for maximum advantage against 100% resistance

fantasy versus real M.A.
DISTINCTION IN HOW THEY TRAIN
    that's the self-correcting mechanism
    
To get good you have to be willing to lose sometimes

don't pretend to know stuff you don't have any way of knowing

###Q & A###
How many hours does it take to become "functional" in BJJ? 
    +10,000
    10-12 yrs
     at 2-3 hrs a week
    exceptional 3-4yrs in tournaments

6yo is a good age to get kids started in BJJ

Q: How to deal with weight?
    In watching 3+ hours of street fights[^foot], knowing a guillotine choke could make someone win nearly everytime
    
choice if both of you can't/won't run away:
  (a) choke them (BJJ)
  (b) major body trauma (everything else)
  

[^foot]: akin to Tyler Durden & RSD's "Hotseat"
