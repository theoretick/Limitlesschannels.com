<blockquote>
<p>Conducting three experiments in both real and virtual environments, Radvansky&rsquo;s subjects &ndash; all college students &ndash; performed memory tasks while crossing a room and while exiting a doorway.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, subjects used a virtual environment and moved from one room to another, selecting an object on a table and exchanging it for an object at a different table. They did the same thing while simply moving across a room but not crossing through a doorway.</p>
<p>Radvansky found that the subjects forgot more after walking through a doorway compared to moving the same distance across a room,<strong> suggesting that the doorway or &ldquo;event boundary&rdquo; impedes one&rsquo;s ability to retrieve thoughts or decisions made in a different room.</strong></p>
