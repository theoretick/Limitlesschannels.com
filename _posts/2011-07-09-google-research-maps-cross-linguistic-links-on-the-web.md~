<p>Google Research blog (which until this post I never knew actually existed) just posted some cool data (with chart porn!) on cross-language linkage throughout the web. &nbsp;High linguistic correlations between certain languages across sites mirrors a surprisingly similar geographic distributions, which depending on who you are may or may not have been obvious (I'm undecided myself).</p>
<p>Disregarding the world language of English the languages appear to link across such alliances as former soviet republics and &nbsp;the data even demonstrate geographic isolationist and introverted cultures such as the surprisingly large lack of English among Chinese and Japanese sites.</p>
