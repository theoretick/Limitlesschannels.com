##Monsignor Denis Faul - British SAS NCO Trained Interrogator interview##

_\[In WW2\] The Americans appear to have been more susceptible to the propaganda though, don’t they? Their morale collapsed almost immediately?_ 

That’s a fact. The Americans died out like flies in our camp. And the main reason for that – we were a lot harder in those days than we are now. British troops went into the field with corn dog and hard tack biscuits, if you know what I mean. But the Americans had Tutti Fruttis of all sorts and a lot of sweety goodies in their rations and – well, their rations reflected their home food. Just scaled down. But ours were pretty rough. When it came to the great change from stacks of food to none, the Americans had a lot further distance to drop than we did. And this is what killed thousands of them. We called it ‘no candy disease’. I suffered beriberi nearly to death because I’d not long been in the field and I’d been used to good scoff in Japan and Hong Kong before I got in the field, so I had a bigger drop down in calories than the average squaddie who’d been in Korea for a few months. Those of us like me got beriberi and suffered more from the total change in rations and general well-being. The Americans had a hell of a lot further to fall than I did. That’s why they died.

_Is there a relationship between fear and the likelihood of a prisoner revealing information?_ 

We call that the shock of capture. You try to do everything you can to advance and prolong the shock of capture.


_Hoods, shouting, that sort of thing?_ 

The hoods were not an interrogation thing, they were an MP thing. Shouting was. As perfunctory handling as you can possibly muster. Rough handling but never beating up. Like big, burly – two MPS for every prisoner, picking up each prisoner by his armpits, because they were small, they’re actually quite physically small, picking him up by his armpits and moving him over to the next station and standing him up. That was part of the – I encouraged that. I thought that had a positive effect.


_The fear doesn’t last?_ 

It was quick – really, really quick. The problem at Kandahar was that people would be processed and brought to the general population cage before – for up to 2 hours before. The MPs would not let us have an intermediate holding facility. There was nowhere else to hold them from the last stage of the in-processing to the first interrogation that they had. They just went into the general population. It was a total waste. It could be as little as 45 minutes before these guys all reassured one another and the shock of capture would be so substantially diminished that you would have to wonder if it was valuable any more.


_What about hooding? … So why is it happening, then?_ 

... I registered my first written complaint on January 1st – New Year’s Eve – on that very topic. I said ‘This is inconsistent with the rules’, and the answer I got was not satisfactory, so I wrote it in a proper army format. I said ‘This shackling and hooding prisoners is inconsistent with the Geneva Conventions, Colonel, and isn’t that what we’re supposed to be abiding by. I haven’t heard anything else.’

That got an official response …the response was, and one that I accepted, that prisoners have responsibilities under the Geneva Conventions, too. ‘Two soldiers have been seriously wounded and one killed by prisoners after they have surrendered, so this is a security measure that is provided for in the conventions. For security purposes you can do this.’


###ON FEAR:###

The anxiety was something that – we were always looking to compare how we could prolong and intensify anxiety without breaking the Geneva Convention’s prohibition on coercion. That was a constant debate. But at the same time we were looking to put the pressure on them that would get the battlefield information but still leave as a fruit the strategic information and set them up for a long period of captivity which would include futility, which is the opposite of anxiety. Resignation.

High, high anxiety suits you to get tactical information quickly. Resignation and futility helps you to get the strategic information. We needed to set it up so that the anxiety gave way to futility as quickly as possible. So ironically, once you realised that anxiety was no longer on your side, bringing someone to a sense or resignation and futility as soon as possible, which I think is the opposite of anxiety.


_What about the use of stress positions?_ 

No. Other than watching Vietnam videos, what they did to us in the Hanoi Hilton and such, I’d never heard of stress positions as an interrogation technique.


I thought that interrogation by physical means meant that you hit somebody until they talked, or shocked them, or burned them or something like that. I didn’t know that there was this intermediate – though unacceptable – alternative means of bringing someone to a physical disposition of co-operation. At Fort Polk, school indicated that there was this – that was one of the things that they would do to our own soldiers to simulate what they would do.

And though at the time I dismissed it, I eventually came to the conclusion that stress positions were acceptable but never as a negative consequence for interrogation. As a punishment, yes. But never as an inducement to talk. 


The Convention allows the detaining power to punish people for failure to comply with lawful orders and I thought ‘That’s the escape clause.’ You can do it because when we got to Bagram we were encountering people who were no longer the docile, freaked out – this was a different breed of people. We needed to come to grips with the fact that they were not only not co-operating but also not being co-operative to general military orders and discipline. The problem came in at Bagram that people had different definitions about what constituted lack of discipline. 


Stress positions are routinely used in the American army in training as an attention-getter. For troops. Like ‘OK, hold out two M16 rifles like this.’ That’s common. All the time. More common is ‘Kneel down and hold your hands out in front of you.’ It’s an attention getter. Especially if you can’t do any more push ups. Most troops can do 60, 70 push ups. But after that, how does the drill sergeant punish you? You can’t do any more. So kneel down and hold your arms out.


_Was your training good/accurate?_ 

The American army training is superb for organising a good collection plan. For structuring the pattern and order that you’re gonna question somebody. For example: I can tell you that if you right now said, ‘Questions for a minefield’ I can ask you in order the questions that I was told to ask for a minefield. They drill it into you. There’s no room for improvement or error. You’ve got to ask it as they told you and if you ask those questions, you will be guaranteed to provide the battlefield commander with the information he needs to overcome a minefield. However, the stuff they told us about how to make an approach to a prisoner was useless. Utterly useless.


###Regarding British interrogators###

It was excellent. Their training was extraordinary. It was so much better than ours for what we needed to do in Afghanistan. I don’t know whether they teach their people to do the same questioning as we did, ordered collection plans. If they don’t then they’re missing a beat. But they sure do teach them a much better way to get somebody to co-operate.


_How?_ 

That was the first time I was ever introduced to the concept of layered lying, and the first time I ever even conceived of the time that once a prisoner was broken he might not continue to co-operate. He might change his mind. They covered that, all the different anomalies that I actually encountered. Amazing.


How did you find Brits in comparison to Americans on Resistance to Interrogation?
In Germany we did an exercise against the British army once and this pioneer unit was out doing something and the US took them prisoner. They’d just recently had the resistance to interrogation training short course, three days. We brought them into an abandoned elementary school. The rule was we had three days, and we couldn’t get anything out of them. They were amazing. They kept saying ‘I can’t answer that question. I can’t answer that question.’ They were brilliant. Extraordinarily resilient. 

_Did any Brits fail the test?_

In the end. We put on UK uniforms, said ‘OK the exercise is over’, gave them back their stuff. Took money out of their wallets. \[When they asked where their stuff was\] …we told them to go to the RMP: ‘Right, fill out a report. What’s your name?’ ‘Collin Hewitt’ ‘Colin Hewitt. Unit?’ ‘We’re with the 34th Hampshires.’ ‘34th Hampshires, right. Service number?’ – and we wrote the whole thing down. ‘Right. What were you doing in the field?’ ‘ We were placing mines.’ ‘What type of mines?’ ‘Why do you need to know that?’ ‘Report!’ It only worked with about 2 guys out of about 13 – but it was good enough.



###LEARNING FROM THE BRITISH INTERROGATORS:###


One of their favourite techniques that they taught was, when you in-process somebody – we used to do this at all our exercises, and man did it piss people off! – all the person’s possessions would be placed on a table, they’d be standing there without any clothes on, right after in-processing. So they’re standing there, ready to go into the cage, the cell. You say ‘OK you can have any three items on this table. Got get ’em.’ And he would pick whatever item he wanted. So you’d then take those away and say ‘You can’t have those. Pick your next three.’ (laughs). Very useful!

But they didn’t talk about hooding. They did talk about the importance of forensic analysis of what’s being said. About excellent back-office tactics, about complete near pathological familiarity of the topic at hand. Like, the example I remember is You’re gonna talk about Barcelona’: the interrogators had to go in and memorise Barcelona, like you were going to take The Knowledge.

_What did you make of the CIA’s forays into interrogation in Afghanistan? Some reports state that they were meddling where they saw fit, making things harder for army interrogators?_ 

My buddy kept saying \[there was a room somewhere else where\] there existed professionalism. It just didn’t exist. At least, not to my knowledge. Maybe it does. Maybe they’re all someplace else, fighting a more important war. I was so disappointed, so gravely, gravely disappointed with those guys…

\[one CIA woman\] … You just had to think to yourself ‘This poor lady’s gravely out of her depth!’

I think in the end all of us agreed that she was probably an analyst, that the CIA was sending analysts who were experts in, say Indonesia. 

In an interrogation, where do you draw the line between inducing fear indirectly or directly: placing a gun to someone’s head, for example, or simply leaving it on the table?
That became more complicated later on because we realised that we needed to have more aggressive approaches but we had to justify this with the rules of the Convention, and one of the things that they teach you at the school is that when somebody does not fit the obligations of the Convention – for example a pilot who has donned civilian clothes – they are no longer afforded its protection. And if they are no longer afforded its protection, you can kill them on sight. A NCO or officer can summarily execute people in the field who do not comply with the rules of the Convention. You are under no obligation to accept their surrender.

The other interrogators, my subordinates used to say, the argument was if these guys do not fit the Convention, why can’t we say exactly what they told us in the school: ‘We shoot spies’? My rule was, you can use that approach if we are actually convinced that what these people did was espionage or terrorism. Because we DO execute terrorists (Tim McVeigh) and we do execute spies (the Rosenbergs). So if you could come up with any reason to suspect them of that, anyone who had set foot in America, for example, anyone who had set foot in Western Europe, I was willing to countenance that approach and that you could get quite graphic with what the consequences were.
Is it permissible to threaten, even indirectly, torture – in the knowledge that you are not going actually to use it?
No. For two reasons. One is practical and the other ethical. I would be willing to say that we execute terrorists, and we execute spies and we can say ‘Hey, we’re gonna do this by whatever method. You’re gonna die by firing squad, or in the Terre Haute electric chair.’ I don’t think we can say ‘We’re gonna torture you’ – because we don’t do that.

MI5 manuals seem to indicate that – while illegal and ill-advised – torture can work. It certainly makes people speak faster…
I suspect that that’s right. The evidence suggests it. The louder we were, the more aggressive we were… I’ve never gotten to the point where I ever saw physical violence, ever, but I will say that the harder, the harder we got, you remember monstering? The information we got out of monstering, although it took 28, in the longest time we did it, 28 hours – it got results.

**You know what they call those guys \[from Abu Ghraib\] at the Pentagon now? ‘The 6 guys who lost us the war.’**

###ON INTERROGATING WITH A SEPARATE FEMALE SOLDIER IN THE ROOM###

I believe that you can’t have offences to peoples’ dignity. But I don’t care about offences to peoples’ modesty. That is not important to me. I put her up against that wall, clearly dressed as a female, I made her put here hair in a ponytail, not in a bun. She looked female. She stood there and went through the pocket litter. This freaked the prisoners out. Her back was to them and they were freaked out by it. I thought it was acceptable to the extent that it’s creating anxiety and we’re not offending dignity. We’re offending some local modesty. But I had two talks to her because once she found something in the pocket litter and turned around to tell me. That I wouldn’t allow. I said ‘Whatever you find, don’t fucking turn around. Just call me.’
