description: a short list and discussion of what is required to become your very own spy
---

In following up on a conversation I had recently about what my friend and I wanted to be when we grew up, I think I am finally starting to realize what one of my lesser life-goals has been for a while now (and in terms of concreteness, perhaps that which has seen the most progress).  I think I want to be a spy.  I don't really care about the national intelligent part of it (I actually came rather close to working for the CIA but that's in a different capacity and a very different story altogether) because let's face it, *at the very* least government work is boring.

Probably the most appealing element of this pursuit is the pursuit of everything that being a spy means.  There isn't a country or film studio on Earth who hasn't recognized the bad-assness of spies and special skills and there is a reason.  We don't want to train piles of contract-killer, multinational hackers but instead I see it as an intersection of varied and valuable skillsets.  Furthermore, what makes spies special and gives some practicality to such a pursuit is the development of higher-level skills.  One isn't simply learning "how to fire a gun" but the skills and attitude built around that pursuit.  These are metaskills.  Check out Tim Ferriss' [Top 5 Reasons to be a Jack of All Trades](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/09/14/the-top-5-reasons-to-be-a-jack-of-all-trades/) for a bit more on why this is important.

I decided to try and put together all of the elements that I think make up a spy, or at least what my ideal spy skill set contains.  In listing each and making them actionable I realize I am already a good bit of the way there, but there is of course always more.  This step is easy, the follow-up is where the work is.

###Good dresser###

Learn to dress like an adult.  This came up a while back and it really means moving away from the jeans and t-shirt combo that has served American youth for a very long time, especially here in the Pacific Northwest.  Dressing like an adult means not only having collared shirts, some trousers, and occasionally a sports coat, but knowing how to where them.  This covers such things as rolling and not folding your sleeves, etc.  For me personally, this step hasn't gone very far since I'm incapable of shopping for longer than 20 minutes before I get so utterly sick of it I have to leave.  Also, I'm too cheap for nice clothes right now.  See Art of Manliness' article series for Men, [How to Improve your Style](http://artofmanliness.com/2010/08/12/mans-guide-change-appearance/) and [Style Tips for College Students](http://artofmanliness.com/2011/09/22/style-tips-for-college-men/).  It is somewhat different for women but generally similar; i.e. less t-shirt + jeans combos.

###Self defense skills###

In this case at the very minimum, being able to defend yourself against an attack.  On the other end of the spectrum, doing it effortlessly.  This may not amount to a combat expert but it should definitely hint towards someone in the top 15 percentile. I'm a believer in placing one's goals slightly past realistic, which holds true in this case.  For me I've finally started Brazilian Jiu Jitsu regularly at the suggestion of Peter Boghossian, Sam Harris, and several others (see Harris' post notes [Sam Harris and Violence](/notes/2012/02/28/Sam-Harris-and-Violence.html).  It is easily the most functional combat sport I'm aware of (possibly short of MMA, but given the heavy overlap, one cannot necessarily tease those apart) and it is the easiest to practice without the brain-damaging and debilitating qualities of say Muay Thai and other striking sports.  [According to BJJ expert Matt Thornton](/notes/2012/02/21/matt-thornton-notes.html) it will take approximately 10-12 years of 3-4 hours a week to become "functional" in BJJ, so it is time to get started.  It is a binary distinction however with the difference between those with any combat training and those with none.  The difference between someone who has been doing jiu jitsu for 5 years and one who has been doing it for 10 is surprisingly small, but the gap between the standard drunk fratguy at a bar and a fledgling one-year BJJ trainee can be glaring.

###Firearms training###

This one may seem obvious, and it is, but not in the way one would think.  Being a marksmen is one thing and the likelihood of needing this skill I would consider rather low, but I want to emphasize the training aspect, not the skill aspect.  Training means familiarity and exposure to firearms, which I find extremely important.  In my interactions with different people in discussions of legislation and other matters I have recognize a significant difference in opinions and understanding of guns between those who have been exposed to them and those who have not.  Understanding how to use a gun, how to disable a gun, and both the advantages and limitations of guns are very valuable things to know.  Perhaps more valuable is familiarity around them in such a way as to prevent complete lockdown and the deathgrip of terror upon facing a loaded gun.  Simple exposure lessens this fear.  Remember, [fear is the mind killer](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/2).

###Speak several languages###

All spies speak several languages.  Which ones?  That depends on what you'll be doing and where you'll be going.  Learning a second language is difficult, learning a third, less so and will continue to get easier as one goes on.  Few people will have any practical utility for 5 languages, but again we are working on toolbox metaskills, not the skill itself.  There is plenty of evidence regarding the benefits of bilingualism ([for one](/language/2011/10/15/first-physical-evidence-bilingualism-delays-onset-of-alzheimers.html)) but it really comes down to a mixture of exercising one's brain and recognizing the value of varied approaches.  For learning, Paul Pimsleur's [Pimsleur Language Learning system](http://www.pimsleur.com/) makes the most effective language tapes around in a variety of tongues, utilizing an excellent combination of spaced-repetition, length based on limitations of human attention, and free recall.  Paired with such programs as [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) with top 200 word frequency lists, and mixed exposure approaches (read news, watch tv, and listen to the radio in that language) one will be bilingual in no time at all.

###Body language and lie detection###

Reading people is beyond valuable in every sphere of social life.  Being able to tell a lie is equally valuable and will actually help you to lie better yourself when you understand what marks your own body and language.  The classic shiftiness and idealized twitches of guilt is bullshit, however.  There are no universals to lying, merely deviations from standard behavior.  One of the classic mind-reading techniques is to ask someone three questions and tell them to lie to you with one.  The reader can then recognize body cues and with which answer one alters their body language.  There are a few common themes that aren't quite universals but more educationally self-fulfilling prophecies however.  People have been told for so long that eye contact is important that liars will often hold eye contact far longer than average and try and maintain a truthiness posture unlike any average.  But these cues are few and far between and instead one should learn to read others's personal cues and simply recognize alterations from the norm.  There are countless sources for getting better at this and no specifics come to mind but try out a bit of clever googling and just start paying attention.  Open up that third eye.

###Spy clothes###

Spies have awesome clothes.  These aren't necessarily the stylish clothes previously mentioned in "dressing like an adult" but clothes that are by and large feature-filled and things like reversible.  Clothes that have tons of pockets. Clothes that are made for infiltrating.  [Scottevest](http://www.scottevest.com) is one such brand that will outfit you will more pockets than you could possible use.  I have yet to find a cool and useful reversible jacket outside of any kids section, however.

###Always carry tools and gadgets###

Get in the habit of carrying tools. These don't have to be bulky or anything too crazy but make sure you are set for the basics.  I personally carry my Leatherman (I am fond of the [Wave](http://www.leatherman.com/product/Wave])), a [Utilikey](http://www.amazon.com/Swiss-Tech-UKCSB-1-Utili-Key-MultiTool/dp/B0001EFSTI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1335805755&sr=8-1) which I have yet get caught sneaking on to an airplane, and a top of the line smartphone.  In terms of smartphones I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy S II but I happen to change frequently and radically so that will be outdated pretty quickly.  The phone is expensive but invaluable for many reasons, especially loaded with such basic apps as GPS, levels, measuring tapes (augmented reality camera apps abundant), calculators, maps, and all the other goodness that comes with it.

###Basic-to-Advanced hacking skills###

This is probably the least realistic in terms of skill building. Also, it's kinda BS, but ignore that part for now.  There are countless online articles on why everyone should program ([here's a](http://www.conorneill.com/2012/03/everyone-must-learn-to-code.html) [couple](http://reviewsindepth.com/2011/04/why-everyone-should-learn-to-program/)) and even a few on how some people are incapable (see [this fascinating article off CodingHorror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/07/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats.html)).  In this case, I do find it to be a skillset everyone should at the very least explore but many people are simply neither interested nor committed to anything beyond basic coding.  I suggest familiarity with operating system structure, understanding UACs (win) and permissions (everything else), and throw in a basic understanding with types of computer attacks (see side-channel attacks, DDOS, buffer overflows, and brute-force attacks).  Otherwise it is all the basics people have been trying to drill into you for years: use secure passwords, use and understand encryption, and know how to handle yourself online.  If you do feel like tackling coding, start with the excellent [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/).  Python is a powerful, simple, and popular language and Zed Shaw's book is the cleanest and best there is.

###Basic electronic skills###

This will aide you in more ways than one.  Understand the difference between AC and DC current, know some basic howto repairs, and know why you don't stick a fork into an outlet.  I won't suggest playing around in a fuse box but how about picking up a DIY electronics book, like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1335806680&sr=8-4).
