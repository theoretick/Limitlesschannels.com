<p>New translations are fun, apparently this year a new edition of The Bible in Norwegian has been released and its ben incredibly well-received. &nbsp;While lightly addressed in the article, i'm curious how many bought it for true religious reasons or just to update their collection or read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirty consultant translators, priests and academics translated the Greek and Hebrew original into Norwegian for the new edition, with a team of 12 literary authors including Knausg&aring;rd and playwright Jon Fosse then smoothing out that text. "Obviously it was very important to get the right translation but they also wanted it to be readable, to make sure it was good literary language," said Smemo Strachan. "None of these authors are religious - they are all just very good literary writers who thought it would be an interesting project to be involved in."</p>
<p>&nbsp;...</p>
<p>A "literary" version of the Bible, with no chapters or verses which "reads like a novel", has also been published and has "sold incredibly well", said the publisher.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.norway.org.uk/aboutnorway/society/people/general/">According to official data, 80% of Norway's population of 4.9m belongs to the Church of Norway</a>, but not all the new edition's purchasers are thought to be buying it for strictly religious religions.</p>
