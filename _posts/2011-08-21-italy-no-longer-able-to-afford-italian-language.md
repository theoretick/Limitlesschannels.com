<p>Apparently the foremost institute for maintenance of the Italian language (think '<em>L'academie francaise</em>' of Italy) can <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/19/italian-language-under-threat-cuts" target="_blank">no longer sustainably afford to fund its own language</a>. &nbsp;The struggle between people who try and govern the language with an iron fist and economics has always been an interesting and arbitrary one. &nbsp;Still, it is one that a shockingly large subset of people think is necessary and there are many languages around the world with such similar institutions (see Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_academies" target="_blank">List of Language Regulators</a>).</p>
