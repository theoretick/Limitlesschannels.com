<p>Just a brief excerpt from a much more fascinating complete debate, make sure to click through. &nbsp;In response to musings by Grandin, an animal scientist, in some of his best-selling books some members of the neuroscience community have responded with some great observations on either side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...[in response to Grandin] the authors argue, rather than having privileged access to lower level sensory information before it is packaged into concepts, as has been argued for savants, animals, like non-autistic humans, process sensory inputs according to rules, and that this manner of processing is a specialized feature of the left hemisphere in humans and nonhuman animals.</p>
<p>At the most general level, they argue, "the left hemisphere sets up rules based on experience and the right hemisphere avoids rules in order to detect details and unique features that allow it to decide what is familiar and what is novel. This is true for human and nonhuman animals, likely reflecting ancient evolutionary origins of the underlying brain mechanisms."</p>
