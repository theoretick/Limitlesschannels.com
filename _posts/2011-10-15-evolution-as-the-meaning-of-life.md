<p>Seems like a decent enough argument. &nbsp;via subreddit for "test my belief, reddit." &nbsp;Click <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TMBR/comments/i7z56/i_believe_that_evolution_is_the_meaning_of_life/" target="_blank">here </a>for the continuation of the discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To evolve and to ensure the best possible conditions for us and our offspring's survival seems to me a perfectly good replacement for religion as a source of moral structure, and a source of life guidance.</p>
<p>I feel perfectly well assuming my goal in life to be to work to adapt to the environment, and secure my genes' continued survival in the best possible conditions. Ultimately, all of my life choices come down to evolutionary strategies that either succeed or fail. Why do we get up in the morning and go to school and have jobs? So we can have a better life? Why have a better life? So we can better ensure our survival.</p>
<p>Moral values appear naturally as soon as we start living together as a group. Harm against our own kind is for most cases detrimental for our survival as a group, or as a species. A balance between personal needs and the needs of the group must be achieved. The golden rule would be not to interfere with other peoples' evolutionary strategies, as long as they don't interfere with yours.</p>
<p>At the same time, evolution is a concept that must necessarily adapt to its context, which makes for a much better guideline than an immutable rule that becomes outdated with changing conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, if we assume that every other organism on the planet has the same goal as we do, it becomes much easier to reason at the same level and gain empathy towards what is essentially the same thing as us.</p>
