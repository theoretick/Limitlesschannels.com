<p>Probably shouldn't try this one at home yet, but BBC has a new article on the use of electricity in increasing the brain's susceptibility to learning new patterns. &nbsp;In the study the participants received light electrical stimulation leading to quicker learning in terms of motor tasks. &nbsp;Hopefully future research can use this stimulation applied to other regions of the brain, as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of the button-pressing experiments showed the positive effects of just 10 minutes of the brain stimulation on learning, compared to a similar "placebo" setup in which the electrical stimulation was not used.</p>
<p>"While the stimulation didn't improve the participant's best performance, the speed at which they reached their best was significantly increased," said Prof Johansen-Berg.</p>
<p>Targeting the area of the brain that controls motor skills allows movement tasks to be learned more quickly, and the researchers envisage the technique could be used to help in the training of athletes.</p>
<p>The experiments have explicitly shown that stimulating the motor cortex of the brain can increase the speed of learning motor skills.</p>
