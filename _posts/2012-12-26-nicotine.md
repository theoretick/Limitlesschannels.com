On rare occasions over the past few years I have smoked cigarettes.  Usually at a bar or another social environment, be it a result of those around me or some weird form of boredom, I have often found it a fascinating habit. My interest lies in nicotine's colorful and fascinating resume including its high degree of social acceptability, its links to <a href="#note2">hormone production and DHT</a>, its effects <a href="#note3" >as a pain-killer</a>, and even the seemingly contradictory evidence of its effects as both a stimulant and a depressant (see below).

Unfortunately, cigarettes are messy and quite problematic.  I was curious about what exactly nicotine can do and the easiest way to control for the bevy of factors tied to cigarettes (social conditions, weather, countless side-effects, inconsistency of dosage by brand or individual cigarette) I decided to try out some nicotine patches.

##Background##

<p>As one of the premiere social drugs, Nicotine has been around for a long time and generated a laundry-list of side effects, interactions, correlations, and benefits.  There has been countless research on its cognition-enhancing effects, addictiveness, relationship to pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, and its effects as a mood modifier.</p>

<p>Cigarettes are problematic, the uneven dosage can be equally problematic both from the brand variations as well as inconsistencies with such basic habits as, say, frequency of "pulls" when inhaling. 
<a href="#note4">Here's a chart from a 1994 FTC study</a> about nicotine and tar content of the top domestic cigarette brands.</p>

<p><strong>In terms of long term effects of the study, it appears to be quite safe in terms of addiction and long term harmful effects.</strong> Regarding diabetes, the interactions between nicotine and glucose metabolism have been discussed previously with one study citing greater nicotine sensitivity **only** in people predisposed. Nicotine absorption at 14mg <a href="#note5">"resulted in nonsignificant trends for increased insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels."</a>  As noted with that link, nicotine can affect healthy and diabetic people differently, but has no statistically significant results for healthy individuals.  For sake of argument I found <a href="#note6" >a more "human" study of nicotine gum leading to higher insulin resistance</a>, but don't find n=40 to be particularly compelling, though, perhaps more than rats.</p>

<p>In terms of published research all I've managed to find so far on depression has been <a href="#note7">one case study</a> of a 48yo man with adult ADHD who used nicotine as a successful treatment for depression and anxiety. I'm curious whether or not that man had the aforementioned genetic marker, but there was no mention in the paper.  Other various reports online include such sites as drug-forums.com and erowid.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding addiction,</strong><a href="#note8">it does not appear that the addictive properties involved in cigarettes or smoking are directly an effect of nicotine itself, but are instead an effect of the MAOI inhibitory activity of smoking tobacco</a>. It is not the nicotine that is necessarily addictive.  I'll post my thoughts on any "withdrawal" when the week is completed, but have no expectations for cravings first because of the aforementioned research and second the abstract nature of my method (the patch) leaves it difficult for me to have any sort of reference point for cravings.  The passiveness of the patch gives me no mental anchor like a cigarette I can obsess over.</p>

<p>There has been <a href="#note9">some previous research</a> as well that links nicotine's addictiveness to a specific genetic signature.  One such study showed that the CHRNA5 gene may be responsible for the pleasure smokers get from their first cigarette and may be directly responsible for the path of lifelong smoking all the way to throat/lung cancer.</p> 

<p id="presence">My original 14-day setup required some revision as I've found several sources that point to nicotine's <a href="#note10">continued presence in the body for 2-4 days after absorption</a>.  The two main metabolites in nicotine are N-Oxide and Cotinine.  N-Oxide tends to leave the body in 72 hours and Cotinine can remain for much longer, four days up to one month.  While I have noticed some definite variation in the subject matter on both absorption and presence depending on method of delivery, there isn't a whole lot on transdermal delivery.  <a href="#note11">One study listed Cotinine as having no effect on withdrawal symptoms</a>, while another listed <a href="#note12">little significant difference in withdrawal symptoms (irritability and cravability) among placebo groups and 15mg patch groups due to Cotinine levels</a>.  In light of these two papers, I'll consider its continued presence not significant regarding my body's clearance (<strong>Updated:</strong> please view <a href="#note1">Footnote1</a> and <a href="#summary">Summary</a> for an important note on this topic).  I'll say 48 hours seems sufficient for my purposes.</p>

##Setup##

<img src="/storage/nicotine-cycle-chart.png" width="100%" />

###- Stage 1:  1 week daily patch###

###- Stage 2:  48hr "detox" and rest###

###- Stage 3:  1 week control (no nicotine)###

The standard patch kits come in a 3-week supply: first week with the strongest dose and incrementing down to nicotine free on the fourth week.  Since I am not a standard smoker I decided to buy the second week transition system of 14mg transdermal patches (specifically CVS brand Habitrol patches).  Apparently the three-week cycle was rebranded for this kit as a three-step cycle and mine included a total of 14 patches, for a full two-week dosage.  As stated on the box:

<p class="blockquote"> "if you smoke 10 or less cigarettes per day: start with stage 2"</p>

I'll make a note however that this is definitely not the cheapest way to accessibly get nicotine, having paid $15 for the pack compared to a $6 pack of cigarettes, it was at least the greatest per-dollar volume.  A standard cigarette will provide 1 to 1.5mg of nicotine each.  As stated above, smoking 10 cigarettes a day (the supposed equivalent of one patch) <strong>will net you 4mg LESS nicotine than the equivalent inhalant delivery.</strong>  If nothing else, I prefer the transdermal to inhalatory (or enteral for that matter) method.

Each night I'll be removing the patch about two hours before going to sleep.

After the week of patches I'll go "cold turkey," wait approx 72 hours, and try out one week without for a control to compare my mood/energy/productivity.  See above for notes about presence of nicotine metabolites in the system.

<p><strong>Regarding measurement</strong>, obviously for testing effects some cognitive measure would be key, but as I've noted with my past experiments with nootropics, I have found it very difficult to find any sort of consistent and accurate measure of ability.  With n-back testing becoming more problematic with each paper I see, my previous 1-5 scale on sleep/exercise/mood/energy seeming quite unsatisfactory and at present have no other scale I'm really happy with, I decided to simply go with an overly basic qualitative log.  This one is a bit less formal than my other stuff but based on the results I will reconsider setting up something a bit more measurable.  I haven't really looked at his conclusions yet, but midway through my study Gwern eerily posted a <a href="#note13">Nicotine and N-Back test</a>, bearing in mind <a href="/main/2011/8/9/what-exactly-is-n-back.html" >N-Back's problematic nature</a>, I'd recommend checking his work out for a more quantitative measure.</p>


##Log##

<p class="blockquote">Note: I regularly drink coffee and alcohol, but to maintain my current routine and minimize confounds I didn't feel it wise or necessary to subsist from either for the duration of my study. Limited, but not abstained.</p>

###Day One:###

13:13 - Patched in this morning at 10am and have had an excellent mild alertness for the past few hours.  Didn't feel the need for coffee this morning but since I can be a puppet to habit I ended up getting some anyway. That was a bit much and I'll probably hold off on the caffeine tomorrow. Haven't eaten yet. I was worried about reports of nausea from the patch as noted in the above "pain management" link, yet no such symptoms.

18:45 - Went to work and worked for 5 hours. Was quite productive and managed to stay fairly focused and upbeat. My current project involves crime victim issues and can mean spending significant periods of time reading through crime case reports, something that for most of this project has been an emotionally draining activity.  I have managed to stay largely upbeat today in spite of reading through some particularly brutal cases.  I'm curious if I'm getting a mood boost with the patch but may be too early to tell, being more productive tends to boost my mood anyway.

###Day Two:###

13:41 - Woke up far too late today (If you want to see how late <a href="/experiments/sleep-data-method.html" >let me plug my other project</a>).  Went in to work and worked for a few hours. First hour of the patch gave me the same tingling/itching behavior as I experienced yesterday but fairly quickly subsided. No coffee this morning and feeling plenty awake and alert. General awareness but a slight haziness from sleep, so there isn't the full relief such reported with Adrafinil/Modafinil or other eugregorics.

18:37 - still alert, still productive, focused, and aware. I finally ate a meal and had a small cup of coffee to keep any caffeine withdrawal off. After this I think I need to take a caffeine sabbatical.

21:39 - Feeling fine, had a beer and haven't noticed any direct conflict. Still maintaining my current energy level and focus throughout the day and not seeing any obvious interactions.

###Day Three:###

12:22 - Awake, well-rested and all that jazz.  No real comments, feeling awake but not quite the same level of alertness as the last two days.  Might consider adding in a "rest day" to restart my metabolism but tolerance is such a damn hard thing to measure and varies person-to-person it's really too early to tell.  Coffee didn't quite give me the overcharge I got when I stacked the two on Day One.

###Day Four:###

11:37 - Haven't been sleeping great the last few nights. I've been getting a solid 7-8 hours, too.  I'm curious if I'm crashing harder than sans nicotine but it might just be a few bad nights. It doesn't appear to deviate too much from my standard data.  Another thing I've been noticing has been my appetite.  I actually feel that I've had less of an appetite than normal the last four days yet last night and today It has started to come back.  Between the two of these symptoms I believe my tolerance might be building but I'll have to see how alert I am later tonight as a key determinant.

22:28 - twelvish hours later, had an insanely productive day, lots of reading, lots of writing, reorganized some stuff, and finally caught up on my backlog of Anki.  If my earlier idea was true then the tolerance is a slow build.  Probably the most interesting thing about the transdermal patch is the slow, low release throughout the day so there's no "peak" as there would be with caffeine or any prescribed medication, if so, then the consistency is a definite factor in the effectiveness of the patch.  What's interesting is that this effect would of course be lost on the average smoker, so I wouldn't say my experiment is a good representation of nicotine as a commonly consumed substance but instead with this more consistent and stable form.

23:49 - bit of a headache.  I'll be going to bed early.

###Day Five:###

13:54 - Sleep quite well last night so I think any ideas on the nicotine's effect on my sleep can be thrown out.  Today I've been doing well, customary alertness of the last few days and pretty upbeat.  For the most part I have maintained some semblance of mood stabilization the last few days and have today as well.  I'm again hesitant to attribute that to the nicotine but I've been more upbeat and focused for the duration of the experiment than I have been for a while and am unaware of any direct lifestyle changes otherwise. I'll have to see in the "control week" following up how my mood goes and whether or not I'll stay similarly consistent. Unfortunately, it appears nicotine maintains some presence in one's body for 2-4 days or even up to 1 month [\(Updated, see above background\)](#presence).  I'm honestly not sure I want to commit the time necessary to make sure it clears my body, so I'll have to decide on that in two days.


###Day Six:###

13:44 - A bit tired today, slept plenty but I think the nicotine might be waining.  Just picked up some coffee.  My productivity level has been insane the last few days and I've been breezing through my todo lists, so that's still been fantastically effective but perhaps I'm just working efficiently lately.  Mood stability has tended to be good throughout the day but I've had a few mood swings and down nights.  Unfortunately, I haven't paid close enough attention to see if those matched my nightly patch removal prior to sleep.  I believe mood changes have generally tended to be around that time, however.

###Day Seven:###

Dawn of the final day

15:33 - Got my patch on a bit late today.  Ran out and got some errands done and threw it on several hours later than usual.  Felt a bit of fatigue and definite slower recovery from morning drowsiness, which appears to be a result of the slow patching.  Slept fine, I believe, but have yawned a couple times yesterday and today, something I don't recall happening earlier in the week.  After putting the patch back on I've bounced back to my standard alertness of previous days but I think I'm starting to finally feel a bit of a tolerance that's been building over the last day or two.  I'll say 4 or 5 days seemed to be stable before my body adapted.  Still a definite effect but diminished from the onset of the week.

###Rest Day(s):###

12:23 - First day off the patches and slouching towards a nicotine-free system.  Had a slight headache this morning but doubt it was related as it came on too quickly to be symptomatic of my lack of nicotine.  Energy level is ok, not bad and not particularly good.

22:40 - Later in the day headache came back strong, which seems to be a sign of nicotine withdrawal.  Other common symptoms (irritability, difficulty focusing, tiredness) have not presented.

15:03 - No head ache today, slept a bit longer than average last night but once I got up my energy has been good. I no longer feel like I have the stellar concentration I had before but I haven't noticed any real difficulties concentrating.  I no longer look up and realize I have been working for 4 hours straight, which was a common occurrence when my system was under the effects of the nicotine.

###Control Days:###
12:34 - Slept way too much. a Little morning drowsiness still even with coffee, I'm definitely going to miss the steady alertness afforded by the patch.  Sitting down and working, I've stayed fairly focused, but within standard ranges.

##Summary##

While I appear to have had an insanely productive week during my testing, I was quite surprised with both the extent of withdrawal symptoms and the after-effects of the test week.  Now that it has been several weeks since my study, I feel both hesitant and compelled to bring up something that happened during my control week.  I did not record much after (see single post above) but I did experience a pretty severe bout of depression in the aftermath. I am hesitant to contribute this to the nicotine directly but it is definitely worth noting as it was one of the most intense mood shifts I have experienced in recent memory.

That being said, used sparingly, I would highly recommend nicotine as a focused and quite safe cognitive aid.  Nicotine appears to provide excellent focus, a steady alertness (but can be too much when "stacked" with caffeine, which I do not recommend doing with any substance really), and a passive absorption that is rarely a possibility with a stimulant such as this.  The effects appear to diminish after 3 days, a fairly common frame for similar supplements, when used consistently.  For maximum effectiveness and results I would recommend its use for a maximum of 24hr periods with offset rests of 48 to 72 hours. The ludicrous amount of potential interactions and properties of the drug constantly reveal new uses and side effects so bear in mind the versatile and potentially hazardous nature of such usage. 

<p> - <strong>Positive effects</strong> at 24mg include stable longterm alertness (rather than the jitters that accompany caffeine) throughout the day with slow release, increased focus, and mood alleviation.</p>
<p> - <strong>Side effects</strong> other than appetite suppression only presented themselves with withdrawal which included headaches, increased tiredness, and radical mood shifts.  The possibilities of experiencing depressive symptoms as I had are reasonably high with overuse and abrupt "cold turkey" withdrawal of drug, so I would clearly not recommend either overuse or cold turkey withdrawal.</p>

<p id="note1"><a href="#presence">Note:</a> While I found no real studies regarding this, it's definitely worth noting that this methodology may be problematic as Cotinine is marketed today as a antidepressant under the brand-name Scotine.</p>
