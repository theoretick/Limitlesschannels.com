description: Notes from a post on why linguists should study mathematics and when they should use it.

<p>I found in the archives of<a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Lousy Linguistic</a> blog <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/01/why-linguists-should-study-math.html" target="_blank">a great post on the importance of studying mathematics, </a>specifically logic and statistics, in linguistics. With the recent rise in popularity in such fields as psycholinguistics or Natural Language Processing it has indeed become increasingly important but even such basics as transformational grammar and semantic analysis have been enhanced through mathematical thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Linguists should study math* because</strong>...</em></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em></p>
  <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
    <li><em>Math is a tool that helps you.</em></li>
    <li><em>It's not that hard.</em></li>
    <li><em>Math is good training for the mind.</em></li>
    <li><em>Math is the future.</em></li>
    <li><em>You will be left behind without it.</em></li>
    <li><em>You will be a better linguist.</em></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>An important caveat and one of Chris' excellent points in the post is the importance but not over-importance of utilizing mathematical analysis within linguistics. Yes, it is extremely helpful and important for all the listed reasons but the goal is linguistic analysis-- not mathematical-- and to rely too heavily on math will lead to inaccurate and bad language work.</p>

<p>Why? Because language is based on human thought and as humans we are not rational creatures. We try to be, and it is a worthy pursuit, but at best one is imposing a rational framework on an irrational system.</p>

<p>Actually, in an older separate post he writes on this very point, although in a somewhat different context on his <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2007/12/linguists-vs-economists.html">Linguists versus Economists</a> piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"<em>Part of the difference is probably due to the fact that economists work under the assumption that economic decisions are conscious and rational while linguists work under the assumption that linguistic decisions are automatic or unconscious</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So.. mathematics, good, but handle with care or you could be one of those <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/651912.html">anthropologists</a>/biologists/mathematicians/game theorists who pop up every other week with a new "I just spent 10 minutes figuring out how language works" theory. <a href="http://xkcd.com/793/" target="_blank">Relevant</a>.</p>
