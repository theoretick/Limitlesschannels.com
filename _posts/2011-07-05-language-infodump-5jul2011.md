<p>Contrary to popular opinion,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20076886-10391704.html" target="_blank">new Australian study</a> shows no lasting effect in the 1 in 10 children who learn to talk later. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Over on the Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jul/05/teaching-english-fractal-grammar-claypole" target="_blank">Bringing Chaos theory to English Language Teaching</a> discusses application in light of the constant issues involved in mapping spoken language and the organic growth of grammatical rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice video floating around on <a href="http://digg.com/news/lifestyle/the_history_of_the_english_language_in_10_minutes" target="_blank">History of the English Language in 10 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>The always excellent Neuroskeptic has <a href="http://neuroskeptic.blogspot.com/2011/06/machine-readable-psychiatry.html" target="_blank">a piece</a> on using Natural Language Processing (the other NLP) for machine-readable psychiatry diagnosis.</p>
