My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/224103899">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
What can I say about one of those books you have known of for ages but just got around to.  I guess that covers most books, so nothing that hasn't been said before.  Snow Crash is one of the oldest and most influential cyberpunk novels (next to Gibson's <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22328.Neuromancer" title="Neuromancer by William Gibson">Neuromancer</a>) and deserving of its fame.  Probably the most remarkable thing about such a novel is the brutal relevance with which it continues to echo.  Ideas of the metaverse and future (or presence) of the tech world, the decimation of govt in favor of corporate rule, and even the perpetuity of human nature.<br/><br/>I have issues with books that are written in a goofy/absurdist writing style and it takes me a while to get over such a key feature of a novel.  Once my annoyance with that abated I enjoyed the work far more.<br/><br/>The best stories are those that are built within a world of equally good ideas; ones that touch on universes unique enough to bread countless other stories (and often do with sequel after sequel). In this way Snow Crash is an excellent story.  Perhaps if I had read this once it was released it would have deeply affected me, but having read it only recently many of the ideas were ones I have already become quite familiar with, for one William S. Burroughs 1970 <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257504.The_Electronic_Revolution" title="The Electronic Revolution by William S. Burroughs">The Electronic Revolution</a> and idea of language as a virus.  While this take is one of tech and a bit less occult my own knowledge of cogsci hurts the feasibility of such an idea within my mind, as romantic as it is.  Maybe I'm just dead inside.<br/><br/>The characters within Snow Crash and incredibly engaging and one of the strongest elements of the novel.  Y.T. is a charismatic teenage girl and probably the closest thing we get to an audience surrogate.  Hiro is likely the most talented man alive and what's not to like about that?  Sword-wielding hacker extraordinaires are rarely boring.  Even the real antagonist of the story, <spoiler>the Aleut Raven,</spoiler> was a fully-fleshed and powerful character for any novel on his own.  <spoiler>He is of course the true antagonist for maybe the absurdist style, or the fact that Neal Stephenson doesn't treat you like an idiot, shows the foe-antagonist as a fat, rich media-mogul with an evily-twisted mustache</spoiler>.<br/><br/>I learned things from this novel and that's probably the highest praise I can give a book.

<p>What about the absurdist writing style bothers you? And are you saying you think language is not a virus?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what bothers me about it exactly but it just seems goofy and annoys me.  Most things that annoy me are pretty irrational so it is probably just a pet peeve of mine.  I would like to think that language is a virus but the more I learn about language and neuroscience the less true it seems.  Language itself isn&#39;t a virus but maybe just an instrument of the mimetic virus.  Just thinking, I&#39;m not really too committed to any of these ideas right now.</p>

<p>I still think Snow Crash is one of the most run novels I have ever read.  For me it is the closest thing I have ever found that is like a summer Hollywood blockbuster in book form.</p><p>but I do now have to admit that I might totally understand your annoyance with the goofy style.  I am reading quicksilver and there are some absurd things that I didn&#39;t notice about his writing style before that are bothering me now.</p>
