<p>a piece over on Wonderland about the transgender switch and <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/wonderland/2011/08/17/learning-to-speak-like-a-woman/" target="_blank">learning to speak like a woman</a>. &nbsp;The article has some great information on the therapy process (see excerpt below) and a brief interview on the subject.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I watched from an observation room as a clinician sat at a computer that monitors pitch and asked Caroline to hold certain vowel sounds for as long as she could. To me, her voice sounded quite feminine, but Caroline was tough on herself: After one assessment, she guessed that her pitch was 145. (Anything between 145 and 165 is considered gender neutral.) The clinician reassured her: The real number was 198, very close to the average range of feminine pitch of 210-220. Caroline then read a passage selected to contain all the sounds in the English language. This time, her average pitch was 177, just above gender neutral. &ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t find my voice,&rdquo; says Caroline, disappointed. She also had work to do on her laugh, her cough, and her sneeze.</em></p>
