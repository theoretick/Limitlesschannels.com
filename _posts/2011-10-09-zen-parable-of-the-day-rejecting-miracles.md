<p>The following parable is taken from the 13th century text "The Gateless Gate:"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huang Po, teacher of LInji, one of the most thriving Zen schools in modern Japan, was walking across the mountains when he encountered a monk.  They walked together. When they came across torrent that interrupted the path, the unknown monk rolled up his habit and crossed the waves walking, without sinking.</p>
<p>Turning around, he shouted at Huang Po: "Come across."</p>
<p>He rebuked: "Ah, had I known you were a monster, I would have cut off your legs."</p>
<p>The monk, full of admiration, replied: "You are a true man of religion" and disappeared.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>been thinking about this one for a few days. Originally read in Alejandro Jodorowsky's piece <a href="http://bit.ly/o4Hc5B" target="_blank">Gurdjeiff vs. The Flash</a>.</p>
