<p>via <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111013121701.htm" target="_blank">Science Daily</a>. Known for a while, but only recently have we gotten any concrete evidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Schweizer's team studied CT scans of patients who had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease and who had similar levels of education and cognitive skills, such as attention, memory, planning and organization. Half were fluently bilingual; the other half unilingual.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that both groups performed equivalently on all measures of cognitive performance, the scans of the bilingual patients showed twice as much atrophy in areas of the brain known to be affected by Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Dr. Schweizer said that because bilingual people constantly switch from one language to another or suppress one language to speak in the other, their brains may be better prepared to compensate through enhanced brain networks or pathways when Alzheimer's sets in.</p>
