<h3>Why</h3>
<p>In moving over my site from Squarespace, a well-known and excellent WYSIWYG site editor and host, I wanted to try something different.  Until I am producing content with the quality to surpass whatever medium its presented on, I don't really get the point in hosting a site in which I have no understanding of the innards.  In other words, right now I want an online repository for what I'm interested in and a presence for myself.  Until the information is abundant enough to stand on its own, I will consider the medium to be the message, and this medium is the site coding, et al. Oh, it's also way cheaper.</p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>This site was made possible by many great people who live public online, letting me check out code and their excellent blogposts describing the process. Some of those include <a href="http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/10/12/static-blogging-the-jekyll-way/" target="_blank">this solid blogpost</a> on Recursive Design, <a href="http://bilalh.github.com" target="_blank">Bilal Syed Hussain</a>, and <a href="http://gwern.net" target="_blank">gwern</a>. Other sources include gwern's excellent <a href="http://gwern.net/about" target="_blank">About Page</a>, and a little bit of last minute post-receive Git hooks fixed by <a href="http://twitter.com/reidab" target="_blank">@Reidab</a>.</p>

<p>The source for my site is hosted over on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.  I edit the source files locally, push them to my server and to Github with git, and then on the serverside Jekyll builds the static content and voila.</p>

<p>Rather than start from complete scratch I looked for an ultraminimal html/css pair to build off and discovered the beautiful and clean templates of <a href="http://andreasviklund.com">Andreas Viklun.</a></p>

<p>Hosting is provided by <a href="http://nearlyfreespeech.net">NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>(Recommended by gwern).  It's early but NFSN seems great so far.  It is a pay-as-you-go provider, which makes it a very affordable venture and transition from the ~$20 a month I was paying at Squarespace.</p>
