<p>Benjamin Franklin apparently tried his hand at a bit of phonetics work in reforming the American spelling and writing system after the break from British English. &nbsp;This stuff actually happened a lot back then (Noah Webster largely responsible) including simply altering the spelling of common words to differentiate themselves from British English, like taking the "u" out of color. &nbsp;Benjamin Frankling did a decent job of his new system in preserving oft-missed features like vowel length and variations between fricatives and plosives.</p>
