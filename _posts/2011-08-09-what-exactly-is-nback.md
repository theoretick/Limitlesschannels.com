<p>I've talked about N-Back quite a bit here and since it is currently the basis for my two month long cognitive training experiment I figured I should probably explain this a bit. &nbsp;I gave a brief description previously <a href="http://www.limitlesschannels.com/main/2011/8/2/life-update-blog-posts-and-cognitive-enhancement.html" target="_blank">here</a> but it was more of a hand-off to an overly long and detailed post.  I will probably be talking about this quite a bit in the future and having been supremely dissatisfied with any online descriptions I've found in the past, I figure I can stick all the info and links in one place. This is meant as a brief intro to the topic and by no means complete.</p>

<h3>Background:</h3>

<p>N-Back is training strategy for increasing one's fluid intelligence. &nbsp;That's basically it. &nbsp;Fluid intelligence has been shown to tie directly to that outdated but romantic idea of IQ and the gist is: <strong>increase</strong> <strong>fluid intelligence via working memory and get smarter</strong>. &nbsp;While N-Back has been around since 1958, Jaeggi, one of the major researchers today into the subject, published a widely-cited paper in 2008 titled "Improving Fluid Intelligence with Training on Working Memory" (found <a href="http://1.usa.gov/nJwRMa " target="_blank">here</a>) which really started off the wave of testing and N-Back's entrance into popular culture, such as <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2008/04/smart_software" target="_blank">this Wired Article</a>. &nbsp;Since then, a <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5454984" target="_blank">variety</a> of <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610001091" target="_blank">testing</a> has occurred and in terms of cognitive training, N-Back has proved <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://bit.ly/oOT2Ya" target="_blank">surprisingly robust</a> in both its short term and long term improvements. &nbsp;Of course, I would be remiss if I didnt mention that there have been criticisms, most of which have been gathered <a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#criticism" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>How it works:</h3>

<p>The N-Back task utilizes two main branches in terms of variation, (1) the type of stimulus and (2) the number of turns one must remember 'back.'  The type of stimulus currently falls to either audio, spatial, color, and shape (commonly with the first two fulfilling the role).  One of the most important elements of the task is maintaining multiple channels of focus by doing two things at once, hence the task is usually referred to as <strong>Dual</strong> N-Back.  The default for most software is Sound and Spatial position (see illustration) but I've found color and spatial to work equally well and much easier to use since it does not require headphones.</p>

<br />
<p>The 'N' in N-Back refers to the number of turns back one must recall.  This varies from 1 to as high as around 15.  9-back was the highest I've ever heard of anyone reaching, yet the potential is there for far greater numbers.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 120%;"><strong>A D K F <span style="text-decoration: underline;">K</span> E F J <span style="text-decoration: underline;">F</span> T Y D <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Y</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span> W E Q&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p>So, go out and try some.  One of the more interesting elements of N-Back is the almost perfectly linear improvement from daily use.  While there is some plateauing at some of the more difficult numbers (namely 4 and 5-back) improvement appears to be nearly linear; i.e. more NBack == better working memory.</p>

<p>Back to that longer and more detailed article I mentioned earlier, <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ" target="_blank">Gwern's N-Back FAQ</a> has just about everything else you would be interested in regarding the task. &nbsp;How many a day? What are the limits? Single or Dual NBack? etc.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm quite curious to see how my improvements hold up to Jaeggi's mean data, and while I am a bit less diligent then the peer-reviewed researchers, I'll be happy to post my own improvement after the break come October 1st.</p>

<p>There is a dozen or so options for doing N-Backs on your computer (and even one offline, see FAQ). On the desktop there are various programs on every major OS along with a few good browser-based games such as <a href="http://bit.ly/ptpGNK " target="_blank">SoakYourHead</a>. I've since posted a review of the various Android options <a href="http://www.limitlesschannels.com/main/2011/8/10/android-n-back-app-comparison.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&gt; Since then, a variety of testing has occurred and in terms of cognitive training, N-Back has proved surprisingly robust in both its short term and long term improvements. </p><p>http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ#criticism</p>
