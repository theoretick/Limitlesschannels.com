<p>Looks like a sad day for language learners across the web, Smart.fm returns to its iKnow roots but this time <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/2011/01/26/smartfm-closing-down/">throws up a big ol' paywall</a>.<br /><br />Some new info over on ionpsych: <a href="http://www.ionpsych.com/2011/02/01/effortless-language-learning-not-just-for-kids/">Effortless Language Learning: not just for kids</a>.<br /><br />Don't get tricked with the SEO-worthy catchy title, &nbsp;but some <a href="http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2011/01/linguistics-of-heaven-and-hell.html">nice reading over on Lousy Linguist</a> about measuring Voice Onset Time in pop culture's "Big Brother" to derive a caste system.<br /><br />While I personally think Quora is completely useless, maybe Babylon's attempt at making themselves and their 72 million members the "<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/26/babylon-aims-to-build-a-quora-for-linguistics-off-its-72-million-members/">Quora of Linguistics</a>" should pan out into sheer online Web 3.0 awesomeness.<br /><br />Finally, Radiolab had a <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/2010/oct/08/">great episode</a> a while back on what makes cities cities. &nbsp;The crazy work they do over at the world-reknown Sante Fe Institute in emergent behavior and complexity gets some application in deriving city size and average number of libraries from walking speed and rate of speech.</p>
