It is an excellent volume covering just about every element one must know to have a solid base in phonetics.  The breakdown favors native English speakers, (and American ones in the US edition, at least) first providing a clear description of the phonetics of English including prosodic features, consonants, and vowels before moving on to all other sound systems.  It is fantastically complete given the size.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the volume lies in the insightful walkthroughs on producing some of the more difficult sounds, using such hints as how to determine which method of articulation one uses to produce the American English "R."  To determine whether one bunch the tongue or curl the tip up, carefully insert a toothpick between one's teeth and judging by the point of contact on the surface or bottom of the tongue, it is easy to figure out.  Other techniques, such as sucking in air to feel exposed areas for laterals, all provide extremely helpful ways of both identifying and articulating nearly all sounds.  Furthermore, each chapter end includes a bevvy of performance exercises one can use to practice and alternate between sounds, getting down the rhythm of expression.<br /><br />One of the only real weaknesses to the volume is in the CD portion.  While immensely helpful, the CD was not updated between the 5th and 6th edition (even though it has "6th" printed on it).  The exercises on the CD therefore do not match those in the book, yet it is really only a different order so still usable.  On that point, I really noticed no differences between the 5th and 6th edition other than the exercises, which pisses me off to the classic tune of the publisher's release of a new edition for no legitimate reason.  Especially given this book is expensive as sin (I paid around $120 for a new edition).<br /><br />Those bureaucratic complaints aside, this book is the best there is currently for phonetics from of the most important people to have worked in the field.  The illustrations and charts are extremely helpful for driving home points, the aforementioned descriptions are useful, and the glossary in the end is excellent.  If you want to study some phonetics, get this. <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>
