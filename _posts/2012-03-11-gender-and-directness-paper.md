In examining utterances the field of speech acts has looked at a number of important factors.  Some of these include analyses of categorical distinctions and others at such factors as interpretation of utterances.  One important distinction is directness.  While previous research has been sparse, there is some work suggesting possible gender differences in realizations of directness.  In this paper it is proposed that there are such gender differences, where female speakers favor more indirect request behavior than their male counterparts, specifically non-conventional indirectness.  First will be presented background on speech act theory and directness, then presentation of previous gender research, next analysis of collected data, and finally concluding comments.  

###Background###
The idea of the direct and indirect distinction rests within the field of what is known as Speech Act Theory.  Speech Act Theory, as discussed by Blum-Kulka, et al. (1989), is a pragmatic method of language analysis that considers the smallest unit of linguistic discourse to be not words, but performative speech acts (p. 2).  These fall into various categories such as requests, compliments, or expletives, but the most general distinction in the theory is that of directness and indirectness.  This distinction is between direct speech acts, those where the speaker directly says what they mean, and indirect speech acts, whereupon the speaker's intended meaning is something other than that which they have stated.  This idea of covert and overt meaning can be traced back to such seminal works as Brown & Levinson's (1983) politeness theory along with the idea of face threatening acts, be them "on record" (corresponding to direct) or "off record" (corresponding to indirect).  The connection between politeness and indirectness is an interesting one which has been explored in previous research, such as Felix-Brasdefer's (2005) analysis of indirectness and politeness in Mexican requests.  In an analysis of Mexican requests, Felix-Brasdefer found that conventional indirectness was the most common request form in situations involving power or social distance differences.  By contrast, directness was considered a "way of expressing closeness and affiliation," as is consistent with previous research (p. 76).  

There has been quite a bit of research on directness and some cross-cultural research regarding it, as well.  Directness has been shown in previous research to vary dependent on a number of variables, including Brown & Levinson's three pylons of politeness theory; social distance, power, degree of imposition (1987), along with such factors as setting, medium, and type of request.  Directness has been shown to lessen when addressing people in greater positions of power and to rise with increased familiarity between participants (Blum-Kulka, et al., 1989, 4).  As cited by Blum-Kulka, et al., in terms of cross-linguistic pragmatics, House and Kasper (1987) discovered that non-native speakers (NNS) tended to use higher levels of conversational directness in requests along with such re-dressive and mitigating actions as syntactic downgraders (p. 26).  

In terms of directness and gender, there is less research yet some have analyzed such subject matter.  Even in such seminal works as Felix-Brasdefer's (2005) analysis of Mexican requests, the results were inconclusive in recognizing gender differences in requests, whereupon in the concluding remarks to his paper, the author remarks on the need for a larger corpus (p. 76).  In Nelson, et al. (2001), the researchers used DCTs to compare directness in refusals between Egyptian Arabic and US English speakers.  The conclusion of the paper found strategies to be similar between speaker groups, yet Egyptian males tended to use more direct strategies than English male speakers (p. 52).  

The method of data analysis and gathering was utilization of an adaptive discourse-completion task (aDCT). A DCT is a one-sided roleplay scenario developed to elicit certain speech acts, developed originally by Blum-Kulka (1982) with deference to S. Levinston's work.  As discussed in "Investigating Cross-Cultural Pragmatics,"  (1989)  some advantages of using a DCT over standard naturalistic speech data is presentation of the data in a more standardized way, making cross-cultural comparisons much more simple (p. 13).  This is useful given the way that the naturalistic data have no controlled variables, making analysis difficult.  In contrast, issues that have been raised regarding DCTs have addressed concerns on whether such role-plays legitimately represent behavior of the participants (Golato 2003 p. 92).  

###Analysis###
In analyzing requests, Blum-Kulka, et al. (1989) generally divide directness into three separate categories: (1) direct strategies, (2) conventionally indirect strategies, and (3) non-conventionally indirect strategies (p. 18).  In the case of Direct Strategies the speaker's meaning corresponds succinctly to the utterance's meaning. In Conventionally Indirect Strategies conventional language use aides the interpretation of the utterance.  In Non-Conventionally Indirect Strategies, the meaning depends rather heavily on the context of the utterance.  In this analysis, we have adopted the same distinction.  Based on aforementioned inconclusive research into gender variance, we will be looking at gender differences in both nonnative and native speakers of English to determine if speakers who are female use more non-conventionally indirect strategies to represent politeness, as opposed to their male counterparts.  

The data collected for analysis comprised 21 aDCT role-plays conducted during February of 2012.  There were 21 participants and 20 interviewers, with 7 of those participants being native speakers (NS) and 14 being non-native speakers (NNS).  The corpus involves a total of 78 request scenarios identified by differences in social distance (+/- SD) and power (+/-P), approximately 4 scenarios per conversation.  The scenarios were identified as PromptA (+SD, +P), PromptB (+SD, +P), PromptC (-SD, +P), and PromptD (-SD -P).  An important point to note was the inclusion of the suggestion "be polite" in all four prompts, added to encourage participants to use more polite conversational styles.  The division of gender between participants was 11 female speakers to 9 male speakers, with one participant's gender unidentified.  In analysis in order to narrow the scope of variables I treated NS & NNS as two separate corpora, and analyzed them as such.  
	
The directness categories were applied to the request forms based upon the opening of the DCT dialogue, were there to be a non-conventionally indirect opening with a follow-up conventionally indirect request several turns later, such as below, it was still classified as a indirect request.

Among the data analyzed between native and non-native speakers, NS used direct strategies (4%) much less frequently than NNS (13%).  All groups favored indirect strategies, with an overwhelming preference for non-conventionally indirect strategies in situations that exhibit a +SD component (Prompts A & B), using them 78% of the time.  As prior research has shown (Felix-Brasdefer, 2005), non-conventional directness has not seemed to have any relation to politeness, yet non-conventionally indirect strategies were incredibly prevalent within the data, presenting for NS in 64% of requests and for NNS in 42% of requests, with all prompts including the phrase "be polite."  This may suggests some deeper cross-cultural differences, or perhaps just the psychological perception of politeness strategies favoring indirectness over real-world utility.  

In looking at the use of indirect strategies among female speakers, female NS used non-conventionally indirect strategies in 70% of requests while NNS used them in 45% of requests.   Among NS the remaining 30% were entirely conventionally indirect requests, with no instances of directness.  Only one direct request was present in the rest of the female data, in the NNS' remaining 52% classifying as conventionally indirect requests.  In comparison, male NS used non-conventionally indirect strategies in 54% of requests while NNS used them in 40% of requests.  Among NS the remaining 46% were largely conventionally-indirect requests, with only one instance of directness, reflecting the female data.  Among the male NNS the remaining 60% of requests were evenly divided between direct strategies and conventionally-indirect ones.  In total, female speakers of both NNS and NS indeed use indirect strategies more prevalently than male speakers, with a preference for non-conventionally indirect strategies being favored for situations which had a greater degree of social distance (+SD).  In -SD situations conventionally indirect strategies are preferred.  

###Conclusion###
In analyzing the gathered corpus it has been shown to indeed be true that female speakers, both NS and NNS favor indirect strategies in making requests.  While all groups favor indirect (conventional and non-conventional) strategies in general, female speakers have a 4% higher probability of using non-conventionally indirect strategies, especially in situations that exhibit +SD at a 9% increase.  

In conducting the study again, the most important modification that would improve the data would simply be a more consistent L2.  More data is always something that can greatly contribute to the robustness of a study and while 78 request scenarios were sufficient, NNS may be too broad a category for such a culturally varied topic as gendered speech.  The topic was chosen as it is one of the most reliable variables in such a diverse dataset, yet more data may show it to be problematic.  Some limitations of this study return to the previously mentioned criticisms of DCTs, where the participants' behavior may not be accurately modelled using a role-play scenario.  

Further work in this subject could take into account proficiency levels and age of participants to see if there is any aspect of age-grading or perhaps communicative competence at play.  While such data was gathered during collection, it was not analyzed.  There may indeed be generational factors at play in directness or even L1 background, all which could greatly contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of gender in directness.
