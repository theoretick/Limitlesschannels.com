<blockquote>
<p><em>"By plotting the distributions of words used in financial articles published online between 2006 and 2010 into a computer model, we were able to identify what we call 'verb convergence' and 'noun convergence &mdash; where the language used by financial journalists shows converging agreement. Our study shows that reporters converge on the same language &mdash; 'stocks rose again', 'scaled new heights', or 'soared' &mdash; as their commentaries became more uniformly positive in the lead up to the 2007 crash. They also appear to refer to a smaller-than-usual set of market events &mdash; presumably because of an increased fixation on a small number of rapidly rising stocks."</em></p>
