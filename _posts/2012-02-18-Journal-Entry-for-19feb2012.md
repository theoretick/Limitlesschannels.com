description: Journal entry for February 19th, 2012

This day was a musical one.  I went with a friend to the Oregon Symphony to see one of (allegedly) the world's best pianists, Jeffrey Kahane, performing Mozart's Concerto No. 25 along with a few other pieces.  I personally preferred Cockaigne's "In London Town" due to my preference for dynamics over... whatever the alternative is.  It is a queer feeling to hear what is very often considered the greatest music to ever exist.  Perhaps its "perfection" lulls me enough to not recognize the brilliance of the piece, but as I said, the dynamics of such craziness as Cockaigne (easy to remember as pronunciation follows the nose-candy namesake) seem more memorable.

While I have gone to other "high society" performance things before, mostly musicals and a few dance pieces, this was my first real symphony.  It is an interesting environment of largely older people and a glimpse into an experience I rarely get access to.  I told my companion after how I was glad I am friends with interests so different from my own because I would be hardpressed to commit to going to the symphony without someone else's support.  I doubt I will go again unless it there is some overwhelming performance or my opinion changes, but the epicness of such an experience was a joy to experience at least once.

After the symphony we changed it up and headed to Karaoke.  It was a bit less energetic than last time I went to the same bar but still fun.  The selection was a bit varied but if I had to put the night in a genre it was more drama than the comedic karaoke sessions I prefer.  I sung Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give you up" and my friend and I sung "The Rainbow Connection."  It would appear that success in karaoke comes mostly from familiarity with the material and barely at all with actual singing skill, of which I have little.
