<blockquote>
<p>Born and colleagues (2007) had human subject learn card pair locations while smelling different odors simultaneously (the top left card paired with the scent of my feet, for example). When the researchers reintroduced those same smells during the subjects' slow wave sleep (my feet in the poor subject's face), memory for the card pair locations (top left card) tied to those smells (my feet) were enhanced at recall the next day. Also, through fMRI they saw reactivation of the hippocampus during slow wave sleep.&nbsp;In an alternative study, they used transcranial magnetic stimulation to essentially boost slow oscillations during NREM sleep, which not only increased slow wave sleep and sleep spindles, but also enhanced declarative memory consolidation.&nbsp;<br /><br />From these findings they developed a model postulating that slow waves originating from the neocortex synced both hippocampal sharp waves and thalamocortical sleep spindles, resulting in primed cortical networks for long-term memory storage. <strong>The research team was the first to provide empirical support for a causal role of hippocampal memory reactivation for memory enhancement during sleep.<br /><br />The key point I'm trying to emphasize here is that slow wave sleep and sleep spindle activity are essential for sleep dependent declarative memory consolidation.</strong></p>
