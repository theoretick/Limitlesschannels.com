<div>I have been reading a lot lately about the (for some) militant divide between literary and linguistic analysis of literature. &nbsp;I'm sure I will post more on that when I articulate it, but for now there has been <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/literary-genre-translations" target="_blank">an enjoyable post over on McSweeney's for a sentence translated into 12 literary genres</a>. &nbsp;I rather like the magic realism one.</div>
