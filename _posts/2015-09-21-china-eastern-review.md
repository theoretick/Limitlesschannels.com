description: quick review of china eastern airlines
---


I just got back from a quick trip to Japan (and briefly Shanghai).  The trip was ~11 days roundtrip, with 23 and 5 hours in Shanghai on either end.  At a completely ridiculous price-point of $579 I found my tickets on China Eastern Airlines, an airline I did not know existed until booking.

This was by far _the cheapest_ I’ve ever seen tickets for roundtrip LAX to Japan.  That was impressive.  Even looking now for a similar deal I can struggle to beat < $850.

From what I can tell, _choosing your flight seat_ isn’t a thing in China.  In keeping with that tradition, AFAICT the second largest airline in China does not provide any means of site-assignment before one arrives at the airport to check-in.  In my urge to acquiring a window seat I ended up (A) attempting to navigate the China Eastern site and mobile app using a helpful Yahoo Answers thread on basic CE Chinese and painful translation attempts to find hidden site-assignment menus (B) Calling both China Eastern’s listed Los Angeles and New York offices off their website (both resulting in disconnected numbers), before (C) finally calling Vancouver and getting ahold of a real human being (and a real hero).  She hooked us right up with some excellent window vistas and I am forever grateful for the human touch I finally found in assisting me across the opaque digital company landscapes.  Plus, talking to her was a nice bonus in figuring out whether it was a real airline at that point!

Food.  The _food_ on China Eastern was… weird.  Granted I have pretty low standards, so I’m quite happy with it on my low threshold: filling me up, intriguing me, and not granting any overt food poison.  Each is accompanied with a choice, usually between some composite of fish or pork and rice or noodles.  The rice-based dishes tended to be fairly consistent: a little salad, a hot plate of rice w/ hunks of protein, some gelatinous desert, and what I’ll call a wildcard.  The noodles were a bit more random in the hot plate by size or consistency, but more or less fit the same formula.  Drinks tend to sandwich the meal times, serving both directly before to drink with your meal, and directly after (aperitif?).  There are occasional water checks and a good amount of trash checks at seemingly random intervals in between.  tl;dr - Far from the best but not quite the worst food I’ve had in flight.

The most annoying and by-far most befuddling event was _the phone ban_.  While I fly many airlines that continually make fewer and fewer comments on using one’s phone in-flight, China Eastern has gone towards complete bans.  It is repeatedly stated that phones are not to be used at all during the flight.  That is to say, airplane-mode is not okay, every phone must remain completely shut-off for the entirety of the flight.  That said, laptops and tablets may be freely used with wireless communications turned off.  WTF?  Is this  a distrust of radio chips or some more complex nuance that I’m completely unaware of?  It would have been good to know this one pre-flight, given I opted out of bringing my laptop and instead loaded my phone with podcasts, videos, and a game or two to keep me occupied.  That left my 14 hour flight to deal with a lot of reading and in flight entertainment.

One of the strangest things that I struggle to categorize was the fervent enforcement of what I struggle to decide are either rules or strong-suggestions.  There were a couple of these seemingly abitrary enforcements that still puzzle me.  For one, our flight attendants came by immediately after departure and would either say (in Chinese, which I do not speak) or demonstrate the important of closing the window blinds.  Why that was not left to the traveler at the window, I do not know.  another, the refusal to let a passenger switch seats to an unoccupied and more spacious position once all passengers were aboard.  I’ve trying to avoid any overt commentaries on the PRC or cultural critiques to explain these things, so I’ll just state them and move on.

Still, all that said, not a single airline I’ve seen can beat that price.  *6/10*, would fly again (until I’m wealthy).
