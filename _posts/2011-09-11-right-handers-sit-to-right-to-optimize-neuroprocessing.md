<p>Matia Okubo has published <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2009/12/right-handers-sit-to-right-of-movie.html" target="_blank">a new study on unconscious preferences in positioning for viewing a film</a>. &nbsp;When a viewer is interested in a film or motivated to see it the study demonstrated that 74% of those motivated chose to sit to the right of the screen.* &nbsp;This has been shown to be consistent with previous research on the subject; namely that right-handers favor the right hemisphere for visual/emotional processing.</p>
<p>Summed up from Okubo: "<em>People tend to adopt the most effective manner in which their hemispheric functions can be utilised."</em></p>
<p><em>*Sidenote for the uninitiated: Due to the cross-wiring of our brains, by positioning oneself to view the screen more directly with the left eye acting dominantly, the right hemisphere processes the majority of the input.</em></p>
