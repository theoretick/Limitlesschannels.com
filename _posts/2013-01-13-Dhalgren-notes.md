description: Notes and musings from Samuel Delany's Dhalgren
---

<p class="blockquote">Notes and musings on Samuel Delany's novel Dhalgren. Sitting somewhere around halfway through the novel, it may be premature to have nearly completed my review of the work, but something compelled me to write. If nothing else it should be a joy to see how true this perspective holds upon completion.</p>

Have you ever read an author who writes with a style in seemingly singular harmony with your inner monologue? One who seems to perfectly mirror your thought stream? To say Delany is my inner voice feels almost arrogant and while it does a disservice to the brilliance of his writing, I feel compelled to say this is one of the few books I've felt so closely encompasses my own discernment.

Dhalgren is epic. It's savage and fragmented in a way reminiscent of perhaps a less goofy Pynchon or the bevy of writers who practice schizophrenic writing yet feel compelled to add a sardonic wit (vonnegut, DFW, etc the list goes on). It's a style where one sees the sheer weight of our sensory overload and scrambles to capture every bit of it. There's unending chaos and it's both a colossal exercise and brutal expectation of the reader to stay aboard throughout yet (as chaos tends to do) at seemingly random the swarm shifts and sheer, clean beauty emerges. Swift and sudden it's these moments that put Dhalgren in radical light as a reflection of anxiety, self doubt, pleasure, and the purest elements that make one feel alive.  

As the protagonist states early on to Lanya:  
_"You should be afraid of me."_  
_"I am. But I want to try out some things I'm afraid of. That's the only reason to be here."_

I love cities.  Perhaps it is no wonder then that one of my literary passions is books about cities; they captivate whether they are the classic sites (yes, its a pun, deal with it) and sounds of a single day in Joyce's Ulysses, the deadened undercurrents Bret Easton Ellis' Less than Zero, or the nerdy force of Neil Stephenson's digital landscapes and depictions of "the raft" in Snow Crash.  I might even say that the majority of William Gibson's novels have (incidentally? perhaps not) captured my city-craze; he describes London through the eyes of an American as a "mirror-city" reflecting eerily of the almost universal westernized stylings in a global hub with double-takes over the blurred bits that don't quite fit.  Even Idoru seems an ode to the complexity and viral nature of the Japanese urbanism, even reflected through the pop culture virus of artificial celebrities.

As such, it comes as no surprise that my greatest appreciations of Dhalgren is that it is a story of a city.  The ruinous bones of a city, true, but just as death is a reflection of life, so is the crater of a city the dark reflection of its greatest growth.  That metaphor is most appropriate because I've always found cities to be one of the purest reflections of humanity and life as we know it.  Cities are merely pockets of density.  High density living shows the ever presence struggles of creativity and human achievement; cities reflect the trash and refuse of creation and the beatific nature of collaboration.  Labyrinthine and fractious, those the most historically fucked up have been our "go-to"s for creative inspiration, whether they be [Kowluun The Walled City](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2139914/A-rare-insight-Kowloon-Walled-City.html) or on a smaller scale the creative explosion of such a place as the infamous [MIT Building 20](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/01/30/120130fa_fact_lehrer?currentPage=all), birth of modern radar, linguistics, weather detection, and high fidelity audio.  Even in designing both Pixar's new headquarters and the forthcoming Apple spaceship HQ Steve Jobs saw such value and actively forced employees into a constant state of high-traffic encounters using the atrium as the hub of each buildings carefully crafted design.

But back to Dhalgren.  As a novel, it focuses on a multitude of experiences and feelings; centrally, the work features the overly-told story of one man trying to find himself.  It is easy to dismiss the plot line as something so trite but there are clearly fewer things more central to the self than such a journey.  Taking the emotional journey to a much more concrete level, the city features as a perfect showcase for whichever loss one may feel, the loss of soul or perhaps the more physical loss of a vessel within the decrepit city, stinging like a misplaced set of car keys.
