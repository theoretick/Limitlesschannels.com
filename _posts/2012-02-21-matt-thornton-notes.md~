<h3>PHIL320U - Guest Lecture with Matt Thornton</h3>
<p>From Pete Boghossian's "Critical Thinking" course
<br />Week 7 - "don't believe your eyes" 21feb2012</p>

<p>functional "delivery systems" preferrable to "styles"</p>
<p>To assess a martial art look at how they train. Watch attacker, not defender<br />
note: absence of resisting opponent</p>
<strong>3 Criteria to self-defense</strong>
<ul>
<li>standup (strikes) -- muaythai/boxing</li>
<li>clinch -- wrestling</li>
<li>ground -- BJJ</li>
</ul>
<p>use the minimum amount of effort for maximum advantage against 100% resistance</p>

<p>fantasy versus real M.A.<br />
DISTINCTION IN HOW THEY TRAIN<br />
    that's the self-correcting mechanism</p>
    
<p>To get good you have to be willing to lose sometimes</p>
<p>don't pretend to know stuff you don't have any way of knowing</p>

###Q & A###
How many hours does it take to become "functional" in BJJ? 
    +10,000
    10-12 yrs
     at 2-3 hrs a week
    exceptional 3-4yrs in tournaments

6yo is a good age to get kids started in BJJ

Q: How to deal with weight?
    In watching 3+ hours of street fights[^foot], knowing a guillotine choke could make someone win nearly everytime
    
choice if both of you can't/won't run away:
  (a) choke them (BJJ)
  (b) major body trauma (everything else)
  

[^foot]: akin to Tyler Durden & RSD's "Hotseat"
