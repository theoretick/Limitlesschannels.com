My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191771234" target="_blank">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Thorough and encompassing summary of the language issues involved in one of the most interesting language reforms in history.  One issue I found was the nostalgic tinge Lewis takes on near the end when he begins to lament to the "better times" and loss of certain features; a perspective I'd consider a bit short-sighted for someone woh studies language change at all.  Some basic understanding of Turkish (and Arabic, as well) would be preferable when approaching this book but is entirely unnecessary.
