<p>New research has suggested that with the aide of brain-training games children as young as 11 months old can better hone their focus for later use in life. This research is significant since most previous research has suggested otherwise, that the effectiveness of such early childhood tools is inconsequential.  So up your childs daily n-backs to 5 and turn them into a prodigy.  tDCS always optional.</p>
