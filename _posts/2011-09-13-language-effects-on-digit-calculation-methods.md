<p>A study on "digit span" (how many numbers one can remember when quickly presented in succession) in Cantonese language speakers and English speakers has shown that on average Chinese speakers have greater digit span. &nbsp;This happens due to the brevity of the monosyllabic Cantonese digits leading to greater stringing together of subsequent numbers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This difference in memory span between Cantonese and English may be attributed to the faster pronunciation speed and the intonation built into the Cantonese language. The nonlinear probability of recall curves for nonnative English speakers is a key to understanding the differences in memory span and the applicability of short-term memory models.</p>
