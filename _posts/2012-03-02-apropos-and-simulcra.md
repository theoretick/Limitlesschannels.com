description: notes on plot device leaning-on-the-fourth-wall
---

Following <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3658860">a post</a> I noticed today over on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank">Hacker News</a> I have been thinking a lot about the "elephant in the room" idea and conversationally "going meta."  The idea is that by openly acknowledging the opinionated nature of what one is about to say it greenlights the phrase's social acceptability.  As one HN comment on the topic points out, it has commonly surfaced on the web (memetic tumblr and the like) in the context of <em>"I'm not racist but..."</em> whereupon the effect doesn't quite work.  Others I have often heard are <em>"not to be arrogant, but"</em> or even <em>"this may seem akward, but."</em>

TVTropes even has something to say on it calling it <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" target="_blank">Leaning on the Fourth Wall</a>.  Its prevalence as a media plot device is rather impressive where it has been acted upon as a crutch in difficult situations or even to simply make a show seem intelligently self-aware.

Even in my favorite modern hella-meta show, Community, it has been openly addressed.  When Abed makes a reference to a show and what happens when someone on a show mentions how much it is like tv the moment becomes awkward.  This happens more throughout the show with the occasional <em>"We leaned on that pretty hard last week. Yep, I guess I can lay low for an episode"</em>[^1] or even <em>"yep, this is a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" target="_blank">bottle episode</a>"</em>[^2].  All very indicative of creator Dan Harmon's personal obsession over story structure, <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/09/mf_harmon/all/1" target="_blank">which Wired covered a while back</a>.

I've known about this idea for some time and personally have more and more often started to employ this in my own conversations, because it is both such a powerful and fun way to control a topic.  "not to be arrogant but" is a personal favorite.
