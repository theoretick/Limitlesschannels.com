I've personally never seen the necessity of the Fitbit as it would seem to generate more useless than useful information for me to sift through.  I have however spent a significant amount of time recording my sleep in the past with my phone and other motion technology.  One of my more extensive studies was using a popular motion tracking app on my Android phone called SleepAsAndroid.  Seeing as I devoted <a href="/sleep.html" target="_blank">an entire 4 months of sleep data to it</a> I very much wanted to review its effectiveness against a much more dedicated and supposedly accurate tool, the brainwave-scanning <a href="http://www.myzeo.com/sleep/" target="_blank">Zeo Sleep Manager</a>.

I noticed Zeo pop up as a Groupon deal a while ago and snatched one up for $39, well below the list price of $99.  Since then I've used it periodically and found it quite an interesting experience.

After completing my sleep study and collected a pretty decent amount of data on my own sleep patterns I was still a bit unsure of the method.  Actigraphy, movement tracking of sleep, holds up decently in some research but I wanted to crunch it with this a more dedicated sleep measure, so i recently picked up a Zeo Sleep Manager and have been looking forward to testing the two.  For one week I ran both simulatenously to compare the data from each and the accuracy of motion tracking.

###How Sleep Works###

Sleep is generally divided into 3 stages:

1. Light Sleep
2. Deep Sleep - Generally accepted as 75-80% of your total sleep
3. REM Sleep - Generally accepted as 20-25% of your total sleep, REM has long been considered to be "where the magic happens" but the ethereal nature of sleep research has since redacted that idea.

##The Data##

I carried out my testing over a period of two weeks, each night turning on both tracking simultaneously and disabling on waking.  It is worth noting that about half of my data was generated during <a href="" target="_blank">my nicotine experiment</a> LINK and as I have not yet looked at the data to note any sleep interactions from the nicotine, for the purpose of this comparison I don't believe it relevant. The data is merely for comparison and quality of the sleep is hardly relevant.
