Larson</a><br /> My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/214560743">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br /> There's always more room for making syntax approachable.  Few want to read Chomsky's god-awful, giant (and often imparsable) sentences (see <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://rubberducky.org/cgi-bin/chomsky.pl" target="_blank">Chomsky Bot</a>) so there is always a need for more approachable writing on Generative Grammar.  The beauty of this book, however, is also one of its largest downfalls.  Taking the "logic of argumentation" approach provides a fantastic, solid basis by which to learn grammar and leave readers with a very thorough understanding of it.  The problem with this approach is that if one does not read the book in its entirety, they will be left in many ways worse off than they would have been with a different book.  One will slowly learn method and the reasoning behind such a structure as the incredibly simple "everything is a daughter of S and sister to eachother" approach before immediately abandoning it in the next chapter when a problem presents itself.  Chapter by chapter previous approaches are skillfully and concisely explained leaving the reader with a thorough grasp on why theory has moved the direction it has.  Yet with each chapter one's previous understanding is dashed to pieces creating a cycle of critical thinking and reanalysis, beautifully mirroring both the history and the processes involved in generative syntactic theory.  In the end, the conclusion comes about rather abruptly as well, making the cumulative approach anticlimactic.  The book would greatly benefit from a "further reading recommendations" list or even a solid couple of pages of summary, instead of the preexisting two short paragraphs.<br /><br />First and foremost, this book is an excellent introduction to logic of argumentation, yet with a framing in syntax.  You will learn syntax, learn it well, and learn it clearly.  Just make sure your reading is a complete one since it is a bit too easy to wander off the path early and arrive at the wrong conclusion.<br /> <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>
