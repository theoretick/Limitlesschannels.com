Hennessy</a><br /> My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/194521068">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br /> Nice, positive and full of that incredible quality that makes you want to jump right on a plane, but unfortunately a product of its time.  It isn't exactly old but since the majority of the book and travel in general is highly centered around loopholes of sorts and a pre-internet world (mid 90s) next to none of the data is viable today.<br /><br />Perhaps the better way to look at the book is in a "how you would do it then" sort of perspective, but in that case the entire premise is moot.  If nothing else, it should spark some interesting ideas for the reader on how to get around and a few windows into cities across the globe. <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>
