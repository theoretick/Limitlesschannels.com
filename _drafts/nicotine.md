<p class="blockquote">NOTE: Work in Progress - Last updated 12nov2012</p>


On rare occasions over the past few years I have smoked cigarettes.  Usually at a bar or another party environment, be it a result of those around me or some weird form of boredom but I have often found it a fascinating habit. My fascination lies in nicotines colorful and fascinating resume including its status with such a high degree of social acceptability, its links to <a href="http://www.neurobrainstorm.com/2012/10/why-tobacco-is-still-legal-side-effect.html" target="_blank">hormone production and DHT</a>, its effects <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/85508.php" target="_blank">as a pain-killer</a>, and even the seemingly contradictory evidence of its effects as both a stimulant and a depressant (see below) are fascinating. 

Unfortunately, cigarettes are messy and quite problematic.  I was curious about what exactly nicotine can do and the easiest way to control for the bevy of factors tied to cigarettes (social conditions, weather, countless side-effects, inconsistency of dosage) I decided to try out some nicotine patches.

##Background##

There has been <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080808123144.htm" target="_blank">some previous research</a> however that links nicotine's addictiveness to a specific genetic signature.  One such study showed that this gene may be responsible for the pleasure smokers get from their first cigarette and be directly responsible for the path of lifelong smoking all the way to lung cancer. 

In terms of published research all I've managed to find so far on depression has been <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446482/" target="_blank">one case study</a> of a 48yo man with adult ADHD who used nicotine as a successful treatment for depression and anxiety. I'm curious whether or not that man had the aforementioned genetic marker, but there was no mention in the paper.  Other various reports online include such sites as drug-forums.com and erowid.

<p>Cigarettes are problematic, the uneven dosage can be equally problematic both from the brand variations as well as inconsistencies with such basic habits as, say, frequency of "pulls" when inhaling. 
<a href="http://www.erowid.org/plants/tobacco/tobacco_nic.shtml" target="_blank">Here's a chart from a 1994 FTC study</a> about nicotine and tar content of the top domestic cigarette brands.</p>

<strong>In terms of long term effects of the study, it appears to be quite safe in terms of addiction and long term harmful effects:</strong>

<p>Regarding diabetes, the interactions between nicotine and glucose metabolism have been discussed previously with one study citing greater nicotine sensitivity **only** in people predisposed. Nicotine absorption <a href="http://examine.com/supplements/Nicotine/#summary6">"resulted in nonsignificant trends for increased insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels."</a>  As noted with that link, nicotine can affect healthy and diabetic people differently, but has no statistically significant results for healthy individuals.  For sake of argument I found <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/94/5/878.full" target="_blank">a more "human" study of nicotine gum leading to higher insulin resistance</a>, but don't find n=40 to be particularly compelling, though, perhaps more than rats.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding addiction,</strong><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177026" target="_blank">it does not appear that the addictive properties involved in cigarettes or smoking are directly an effect of nicotine itself, but are instead an effect of the MAOI inhibitory activity of smoking tobacco</a>. It is not the nicotine that is necessarily addictive.  I'll post my thoughts on any "withdrawal" when the week is completed, but have no expectations for cravings first because of the aforementioned research and second the abstract nature of my method (the patch) leaves it difficult for me to have any sort of reference point for cravings.  The passiveness of the patch gives me no mental anchor like a cigarette I can obsess over.</p>

<p><a id="presence">My original 14-day setup</a> required some revision as I've found several sources that point to nicotine's <a href="http://howshealth.com/how-long-does-nicotine-stay-in-your-system/" target="_blank">continued presence in the body for 2-4 days after absorption</a>.  The two main metabolites in nicotine are N-Oxide and Cotinine.  N-Oxide tends to leave the body in 72 hours and Cotinine can remain for much longer, four days up to one month.  While I have noticed some definite variation in the subject matter on both absorption and presence depending on method of delivery, there isn't a whole lot on transdermal delivery.  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9497019" target="_blank">One study listed cotinine as having no effect on withdrawal symptoms</a>, while another listed <a href="http://www.ersj.org.uk/content/9/4/643.full.pdf" target="_blank">little significant difference in withdrawal symptoms (irritability and cravability) among placebo groups and 15mg patch groups due to cotinine levels</a>.  In light of these two papers, I will say that its continued presence is not significant regarding my body's clearance[^1].  I'll say 48 hours seems sufficient for my purposes.</p>

##Setup##

###Step 1 - 1 week daily patch###

###Step 2 - 48 hour "detox" and rest###

###Step 3 - 1 week control, no nicotine###

The standard patch kits come in a 3-week supply: first week with the strongest dose and incrementing down to nicotine free on the fourth week.  Since I am not a standard smoker I decided to buy the second week transition system of 14mg transdermal patches (specifically CVS brand Habitrol patches).  Apparently the 3-week cycle was rebranded for this kit as a 3-step cycle and mine included a total of 14 patches, for a full two week dosage.  As stated on the box:

<p class="blockquote"> "if you smoke 10 or less cigarettes per day: start with step 2"</p>

I'll make a note however that this is definitely not the cheapest way to accessibly get nicotine, having paid $15 for the pack compared to a $6 pack of cigarettes, it was at least the greatest volume.  A standard cigarette will provide 1 to 1.5mg of nicotine each.  As stated above, smoking 10 cigarettes a day (the supposed equivalent of one patch) <strong>will net you 4mg LESS nicotine than the equivalent inhalant delivery.</strong>  If nothing less, I prefer the transdermal to the inhalatory (or enteral for that matter) method.

Each night I'll be removing the patch about two hours before going to sleep.

After the week of patches I'll go "cold turkey," wait approx 72 hours, and try out one week without for a control to compare my mood/energy/productivity.  See above for notes about presence of nicotine in system.

Regarding measurement, obviously for testing effects some cognitive measure would be key, but as I've noted with my past experiments with nootropics, I have found it very difficult to find any sort of consistent and accurate measure of ability.  With n-back testing becoming more problematic with each paper I see, my previous 1-5 scale on sleep/exercise/mood/energy seeming quite unsatisfactory, and at present no other scale I'm really happy with, I decided to simply go with an overly basic qualitative log.  This one is a bit less formal than my other stuff but based on the results I will reconsider setting up something a bit more measurable.

##Log##

<p class="blockquote">Note: I regularly drink coffee and alcohol, but to maintain my current routine I didn't feel it wise or necessary to subsist from either for the duration of my study.</p>

###Day One:###

13:13 - Patched in this morning at 10am and have had an excellent mild alertness for the past few hours.  Didn't feel the need for coffee this morning but since I can be a puppet to habit I ended up getting some anyway.  That may be a bit much and I'll probably hold off on the caffeine tomorrow.  Haven't eaten yet. I was worried about reports of nausea from the patch as noted in the above "pain management" link.

18:45 - Went to work and worked for 5 hours.  Was quite productive and managed to stay fairly focused and upbeat.  My current project involves crime victim issues and can involve spending significant periods of time reading through crime case reports leading, something that for most of this project has been an emotionally draining activity.  I have managed to stay largely upbeat today in spite of reading through some particularly bad cases.  I'm curious if I'm getting a mood boost with the patch but its far too early to tell.  Being more productive tends to boost my mood anyway.

###Day Two:###

13:41 - Woke up far too late today (If you want to see how late <a href="" target="_blank">check on my other project</a>).  Got into work and worked for a few hours.  First hour of the patch gave me the same tingling/itching behavior as I experienced yesterday but fairly quickly subsided.  No coffee this morning and feeling plenty awake and alert.  General awareness with a slight haziness from sleep, so there isn't the full relief such as with Adrafinil/Modafinil or other eugregorics.

18:37 - still alert, still productive, focused, and aware.  I finally ate a meal and had a small cup of coffee to keep any caffeine withdrawal off.  After this I think I need to take a caffeine sabbatical.

21:39 - Feeling fine, had a beer and haven't noticed any direct conflict.  still maintaining my current energy level and focus throughout the day and see not obvious interactions.

###Day Three:###

12:22 - awake, well rested and all that jazz.  No real comments, feeling awake but not quite the same level of alertness as the last two days.  Might be building up a tolerance and might consider adding in a "rest day" to restart my metabolism but tolerance is such a damn hard thing to measure and varies person-to-person it's really too early to tell.  Coffee didn't quite give me the overcharge I got when I stacked the two on day one.

###Day Four:###

11:37 - Haven't been sleeping great the last few nights. I've been getting a solid 7-8 hours too.  I'm curious if I'm crashing harder than sans nicotine but it might just be a few bad nights.  If you're curious, I've been <a href="/experiments/sleep-data-method.html" target="_blank">recording most of it here</a> but it doesn't appear to deviate too much from my standard data.  Another thing I've been noticing has been my appetite.  I actually feel that I've had less of an appetite than normal the last four days yet last night and today It has started to come back.  Between the two of these symptoms I believe my tolerance might be building but I'll have to see how alert I am alter tonight as a key determinant.

22:28 - twelvish hours later, had an insanely productive day, lots of reading, lots of writing, reorganized some stuff, and finally caught up on my backlog of Anki.  If my earlier idea was true then the tolerance is a slow build.  Probably the most interesting thing about the transdermal patch is the low release throughout the day so there's no "peak" as there would be with caffeine or any prescribed medication, if so, then the consistency is a definite factor in the effectiveness of the patch.  What's interesting is that this effect would of course be lost on the average smoker, so I wouldn't say my experiment is a good representation of nicotine as a commonly consumed substance but instead a more consistent and stable form.

23:49 - bit of a headache.  I'll be going to bed early.

###Day Five:###

13:54 - Sleep quite well last night so I think any ideas on the nicotine's effect on my sleep can be thrown out.  Today I've been doing well, customary alertness of the last few days and pretty upbeat.  For the most part I have maintained some semblance of mood stabilization the last few days and have today as well.  I'm hesitant to attribute that to the nicotine but I've definitely been more upbeat and focused for the duration of the experiment than I have been for a while and haven't noticed any direct lifestyle changes otherwise.  I'll have to see in the "control week" following up how my mood goes and whether or not I'll stay similarly consistent.  Unfortunately, it appears nicotine maintains some presence in one's body for 2-4 days or even up to 1 month [\(updated, see above background\)](#presence).  I'm honestly not sure I want to commit the time necessary to make sure it clears my body, so I'll have to decide on that in two days.


###Day Six:###

13:44 - A bit tired today, slept plenty but I think the nicotine might be waining.  Just picked up some coffee.  My productivity level has been insane the last few days and I've been breezing through my todo lists, so that's still been fantastically effective but perhaps I'm just working efficiently lately.  Mood stability has tended to be good throughout the day but I've had a few mood swings and down nights.  Unfortunately, I haven't paid close enough attention to see if those matched my nightly patch removal prior to sleep.  I believe mood changes have tended to be around that time, however.

###Day Seven:###

Dawn of the final day

15:33 - Got my patch on a bit late today.  Ran out and got some errands done and threw it on several hours later than usual.  Felt a bit of fatigue and definite slower recovery from morning drowsiness, which I'll say was definitely a result of the slow patching.  Slept fine, I believe, but have yawned a couple times yesterday and today.  After putting it back on I've bounced back to my standard alertness of the past week but I think I'm starting to finally feel a bit of a tolerance developing over the last day or two.  I'll say 5 days seems to be stable before my body adapted.  Still a definite effect but diminished from the onset of the study.

###Rest Day(s):###

12:23 - First day off the patches and slouching towards a nicotine free system.  Had a slight headache this morning but doubt it was related as it came on too quickly to be symptomatic of my lack of nicotine.  Energy level is ok, not bad and not particularly good.

22:40 - Later in the day my headache definitely came back, which seems to be a sign of nicotine withdrawal.  Other common symptoms (irritability, difficulty focusing, tiredness) have not presented.

15:03 - No head ache today, slept a bit longer than average last night but once I got up my energy has been good.  I no longer feel like I have the stellar concentration I had before but I haven't noticed any real difficulties concentrating.  I simply don't look up and realize I have been working for the past 4 hours, a common occurrence when using the patches.

###Control Day One:###
12:34 - Slept way too much.  Little morning drowsiness still even with coffee, I'm definitely going to miss the steady alertness afforded by the patch.  Sitting down and working, I've stayed fairly focused
