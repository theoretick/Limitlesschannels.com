In moving over my site from Squarespace, a well-known and excellent WYSIWYG site editor and host, I wanted to try something different.  Until I am producing content with the quality to surpass whatever medium its presented on, I don't really get the point in hosting a site in which I have no understanding of the innards.  In other words, right now I want an online repository for what I'm interested in and a presence for myself.  Until the information is abundant enough to stand on its own, I will consider the medium to be the message, and this medium is the site coding, et al. Oh, it's also way cheaper.

This project was made possible by ,, Gwern's excellent <a href="http://gwern.net/about" target="_blank">About page</a>, and a little bit of last minute post-receive Git fixes by <a href="http://twitter.com/reidab" target="_blank">@Reidab</a>.

The source for my site is hosted over on github.  I edit the source files locally, push them to my server and to Github with git, and then on the serverside Jekyll builds the static content and voila.

Rather than start from complete scratch I looked for an ultraminimal html/css pair to build off and discovered the beautiful and clean templates of Andrea Viklun.

Hosting is provided by NearlyFreeSpeech.net (Recommended by Gwern).  It's early but NFSN seems great so far.  It is a pay-as-you-go provider, which makes it a very affordable venture and transition from the ~$20 a month I was paying at Squarespace.
