<p>Been reading about gesture-encoded memory a lot lately. &nbsp;After noticing a recent 2009 paper by Kelly, McDevitt, &amp; Esch on the subject (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01690960802365567">HERE</a>) I did a bit of research and rediscovered one of the more innovative applications of this through what is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPR_Storytelling">TPRS</a>, that's Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling. &nbsp;Having known someone who went through one of the programs briefly, I began to discuss it with them and they considered it quite effective. &nbsp;I'll hopefully post a more detailed description in the next few days when I have time.</p>
