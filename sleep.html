<h2>Sleep Data</h2>
<p>This is my collected sleep data from the Android app [Sleep as Android]() collected over the last couple months.  I will update this data as often as I can.  Much is problematic about using a motion tracker to judge sleep cycles and while the data cannot be a particularly accurate depiction of my sleep, the theory is that one moves less in deep sleep, due to sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>Data collected with <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep" target"_blank">Sleep as Android</a> Android app. <a href="/sleepdata/sleep-export-18feb2012.csv">Current data export</a></p>
