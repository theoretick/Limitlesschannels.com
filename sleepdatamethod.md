description: A comparison of two methods of sleep recording, zeo and actigraphy
---

After completing my Sleep study and collected a pretty decent amount of data on my own sleep patterns I was still a bit unsure of the method.  Actigraphy, movement tracking of sleep, holds up decently in some research but I wanted to crunch it with a more dedicated sleep measure.  Recently I picked up a Zeo Sleep Manager and have been looking forward to testing the two.  For one week I ran both simulatenously to compare the data from each and check out the accuracy of motion tracking.
