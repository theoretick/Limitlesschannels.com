	<p>The always great Mind Hacks recently posted a link to a NYT Opinion piece on the perspective Brazilians have on plastic surgery. &nbsp;I observed this quite a bit when I was down in Brazil and it was fascinating. &nbsp;I've been looking for a piece on this for some time, so <a href='http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/a-necessary-vanity/' target='_blank'>here it is</a>.</p><p>From the article:</p><blockquote>
<p>After seeing the parade, I began to notice that Rio&rsquo;s plastic surgery clinics were almost as numerous as beauty parlors (and there are a lot of those).&nbsp; Newsstands sold magazines with titles like&nbsp;<a href='http://www.plasticaebeleza.com.br/'>Pl&aacute;stica &amp; Beauty</a>, next to Marie Claire.&nbsp; I assumed that the popularity of cosmetic surgery in a developing nation was one more example of Brazil&rsquo;s gaping inequalities.&nbsp; But Pitanguy had long maintained that plastic surgery was not only for the rich: &ldquo;The poor have the right to be beautiful, too,&rdquo; he has said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis and plastic surgery, both once maverick medical specialties, overlapped closely in their historical development.&nbsp; While the &ldquo;talking cure&rdquo; treated bodily complaints via the mind, plastic surgery healed mental suffering via the body.&nbsp; Historian Sander Gilman called plastic surgery &ldquo;psychoanalysis in reverse.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Brazil, as in Argentina, psychoanalysis enjoyed extraordinary popularity among wealthier Brazilians. But many veterans of Freudian or Lacananian therapy have supplemented or supplanted it with pl&aacute;stica. For the patients at public hospitals, psychoanalysis had never been &ldquo;an option,&rdquo; a psychologist who worked in Pitanguy&rsquo;s clinic told me. Echoing the words of the mischievous Carnival designer, she explained, &ldquo;The poor prefer surgery.&rdquo;</p>
