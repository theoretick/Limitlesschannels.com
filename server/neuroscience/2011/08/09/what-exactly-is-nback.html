What are the limits? Single or Dual NBack? etc.</p><p>Personally, I'm quite curious to see how my improvements hold up to Jaeggi's mean data, and while I am a bit less diligent then the peer-reviewed researchers, I'll be happy to post my own improvement after the break come October 1st.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a dozen or so options for doing N-Backs on your computer (and even one offline, see FAQ at the bottom). &nbsp;On the desktop there are various programs on every major OS along with a few good browser-based games such as <a href='http://bit.ly/ptpGNK ' class='offsite-link-inline' target='_blank'>SoakYourHead</a>. &nbsp;I've since posted a review of the various Android options <a href='http://www.limitlesschannels.com/main/2011/8/10/android-n-back-app-comparison.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p><hr />
