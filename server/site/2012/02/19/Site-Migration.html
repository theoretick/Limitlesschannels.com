	<h3>Why</h3><p>In moving over my site from Squarespace, a well-known and excellent WYSIWYG site editor and host, I wanted to try something different.  Until I am producing content with the quality to surpass whatever medium its presented on, I don't really get the point in hosting a site in which I have no understanding of the innards.  In other words, right now I want an online repository for what I'm interested in and a presence for myself.  Until the information is abundant enough to stand on its own, I will consider the medium to be the message, and this medium is the site coding, et al. Oh, it's also way cheaper.</p><h3>How</h3><p>This site was made possible by many great people who live public online, letting me check out code and their excellent blogposts describing the process. Some of those include <a href='http://recursive-design.com/blog/2010/10/12/static-blogging-the-jekyll-way/' target='_blank'>this solid blogpost</a> on Recursive Design, <a href='http://bilalh.github.com' target='_blank'>Bilal Syed Hussain</a>, and <a href='http://gwern.net' target='_blank'>gwern</a>. Other sources include gwern's excellent <a href='http://gwern.net/about' target='_blank'>About Page</a>, and a little bit of last minute post-receive Git hooks fixed by <a href='http://twitter.com/reidab' target='_blank'>@Reidab</a>.</p><p>The source for my site is hosted over on <a href='http://github.com' target='_blank'>Github</a>.  I edit the source files locally, push them to my server and to Github with git, and then on the serverside Jekyll builds the static content and voila.</p><p>Rather than start from complete scratch I looked for an ultraminimal html/css pair to build off and discovered the beautiful and clean templates of <a href='http://andreasviklund.com'>Andreas Viklun.</a></p><p>Hosting is provided by <a href='http://nearlyfreespeech.net'>NearlyFreeSpeech.net</a>(Recommended by gwern).  It's early but NFSN seems great so far.  It is a pay-as-you-go provider, which makes it a very affordable venture and transition from the ~$20 a month I was paying at Squarespace.</p>

<p>Hosting is provided by NearlyFreeSpeech.net (Recommended by Gwern). It&#8217;s early but NFSN seems great so far. It is a pay-as-you-go provider, which makes it a very affordable venture and transition from the ~$20 a month I was paying at Squarespace.</p>
<hr />
<p>It looks like I finally got my new blog up and running, yay!</p>

<p>The basic site is now running hosted at the awesome (and cheap) hosting provider NearlyFreeSpeech.net. The static content is being generated with Jekyll and pushed to the server via Git. I had next to no knowledge of version control systems and only a vague understanding of the precise difference between static and dynamic content websites prior. In other words, I have done very little webdev outside of basic HTML/CSS crafting. Therefore moving from an overly expensive and incredibly simple WYSIWYG generator and host like squarespace to something barebones was an interesting and important journey.</p>

<p>Once I get everything finished I will be migrating over all my posts, adding RSS, figuring out how to throw up a GoogleAnalytics engine, and hopefully getting comments up with Disqus.</p>

<p>I am sure plenty is broken and since I wrote this all for scratch more or less in vi (like an idiot who thinks its important to jump without a net) let me know what I need to fix and if you are feeling up for it pop open the source and tell me where I dropped a close bracket or whatever.</p>
