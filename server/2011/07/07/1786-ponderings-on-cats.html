<p>Short excerpt from the absurd piece filed under "Cat" for the first edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, back in 1768 when it was a mere three volumes with three contributors:</p><p style='padding-left: 30px;'><em>Of all domestic animals, the character of the cat is the most equivocal and suspicious. &nbsp;He is kept, not for any amiable qualities, but purely with a view to banish rats, mice and other noxious animals from our houses... Constantly bent upon theft and rapine, they are full of cunning and dissimulation; they conceal all their designs; seize every opportunity of doing mischief, and then fly from punishment... In a word, the cat is totally destitute of friendship.</em></p><p>Furthermore, they are considered "overly amorous" (i.e. horny) and while pretending to sleep "in reality they are meditating mischief."</p><p>(<em>via A.J. Jacobs' book "The Know-It-All"</em>)</p>
