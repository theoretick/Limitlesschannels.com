	<p>This day was a musical one. I went with a friend to the Oregon Symphony to see one of (allegedly) the world&#8217;s best pianists, Jeffrey Kahane, performing Mozart&#8217;s Concerto No. 25 along with a few other pieces. I personally preferred Cockaigne&#8217;s &#8220;In London Town&#8221; due to my preference for dynamics over&#8230; whatever the alternative is. It is a queer feeling to hear what is very often considered the greatest music to ever exist. Perhaps its &#8220;perfection&#8221; lulls me enough to not recognize the brilliance of the piece, but as I said, the dynamics of such craziness as Cockaigne (easy to remember as pronunciation follows the nose-candy namesake) seem more memorable.</p>

<p>While I have gone to other &#8220;high society&#8221; performance things before, mostly musicals and a few dance pieces, this was my first real symphony. It is an interesting environment of largely older people and a glimpse into an experience I rarely get access to. I told my companion after how I was glad I am friends with interests so different from my own because I would be hardpressed to commit to going to the symphony without someone else&#8217;s support. I doubt I will go again unless it there is some overwhelming performance or my opinion changes, but the epicness of such an experience was a joy to experience at least once.</p>

<p>After the symphony we changed it up and headed to Karaoke. It was a bit less energetic than last time I went to the same bar but still fun. The selection was a bit varied but if I had to put the night in a genre it was more drama than the comedic karaoke sessions I prefer. I sung Rick Astley&#8217;s &#8220;Never Gonna Give you up&#8221; and my friend and I sung &#8220;The Rainbow Connection.&#8221; It would appear that success in karaoke comes mostly from familiarity with the material and barely at all with actual singing skill, of which I have little.</p>
