	<p>Thanks to the excellent story-telling podcast <a href='http://themoth.org/' class='offsite-link-inline' title='The Moth weekly Podcast' target='_blank'>The Moth</a> I was recently reintroduced to one of the seven deadly sins in a way I've never seen or heard previously. &nbsp;One of the less interesting and thus less explored sins is that of Sloth, often translated today as utter laziness. &nbsp;This modern definition however varies quite a bit from the original idea, known as 'Acedia.' &nbsp;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia'>Acedia </a>actually refers to something more along the line of apathy or depression. &nbsp;Thomas Aquinas even had some interesting things to write on that end.</p><p>I actually stumbled upon something along a similar vein a while back when I was researching the "unforgivable sin<strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>s</span></strong>" in the Catholic tradition. &nbsp;For a quick aside I was always curious what that elusive plural included, other than suicide, and after some research concluded that apparently blasphemy against the Holy spirit is one of the only other unforgivable sins, really. &nbsp;Not Jesus, apparently, that's fine, but don't talk about the goddamn holy spirit!</p><blockquote>
<p><em>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, people will be forgiven every sin and blasphemy. But the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the&nbsp;Son of Man&nbsp;will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the&nbsp;age to come.</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote><p style='padding-left: 60px;'>~ Matthew 12:30-32</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even Dostoyevsky had a good bit to say on the relationship between religion and depression. &nbsp;With his exile to Siberia in the latter end of his life, he was supposedly given a copy of the New Testament upon his arrival and with the book as one of his few places of solace, he proceeded to read the text from cover to cover memorizing it and&nbsp;</p><blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;One sees the truth more clearly when one is unhappy, And yet God gives me moments of perfect peace; in such moments I love and believe that I am loved; in such moments I have formulated my creed, wherein all is clear and holy to me. This creed is extremely simply: here it is. I believe that there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, more rational, more manly and more perfect than the Saviour: <em>I say to myself with jealous love that not only is there no one else like Him, but that there could be no one.&rdquo; I confess that one of my coping mechanisms for my depression is that thought &ldquo;One sees the truth more clearly when one is unhappy.&rdquo;</em></em></p>
