	<p><em>Disclaimer: This is one of my linguistics-heavy posts so unless you are of that prediliction or just genuinely interesting in identifying word stress, go ahead and move on.</em></p><p>Started a thread on Reddit asking about identifying stress, here's some of the better responses:</p><blockquote>
<p>The trick that I always learned to identify stress was to pronounce the word with incorrect stress. I'm going to avoid using IPA for my example to better illustrate (with caps) what I mean. For "delayed" (assuming my dialectical pronunciation, of course): DEE-laid or dih-LAID.</p>
<p>These are the two options for stress, either on the first syllable or the second. For me, the first one sounds like a rapper's name D-laid (lol), whereas the second sounds natural. De<em>layed</em>.</p>
<p>The best option when transcribing, however, is to listen to the other para-linguistic attributes of the speech (dynamics, duration of syllable, pitch, vocalic clarity, etc). A vocalic shift often occurs with a shift of stress (ref. PREsent, the gift and preSENT, to display). Some languages have strict rules on where the stress should occur, so that can sometimes help be a guide in determining its location. Finally, keep in mind that stress can also be altered to determine emphasis or can be affected by pauses in speech, so if you can identify those secondary causes, it might help you in figuring out the exact location of the stress.</p>
</blockquote><p>and another one:</p><blockquote>
<p>When you're trying to figure out the stress of just a single word, try saying the word naturally, like you would in a sentence or normal discourse. If you enunciate all the syllables in the word, then of course that makes it more difficult. English has vowel reduction--i.e. on unstressed syllables, the vowel tends to get reduced to a schwa. So <strong>listen for schwas, that'll indicate it's an unstressed syllable</strong>. In my dialect, I would&nbsp;<em>never</em>&nbsp;say [di.lejd] (unless I'm really enunciating), but rather [d…ô.lejd]. So the stress is on the second syllable the way I say it.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Stressed syllables are also longer in duration and louder.</strong></p>
</blockquote><p>and another one, perhaps the simplest:</p><blockquote>
<p>Try humming, marching or clapping your hands as you pronounce the words. You can also say them very loud.</p>
</blockquote>
