<p id="intro">On November 13th of 2011, I and <a href="#note1">several other members<sup>1</sup></a> of PSU's <a href="http://srl.pdx.edu/" target="_blank">Survey Research Lab</a> conducted an intercept survey with 134 participants within the Occupy Portland encampment.  This was less than 24 hours before the forced eviction and we managed to collect survey samples (40-question) from each participant.  Below is accumulated data and report draft.  The raw data can be found linked below on this site and the available summaries below, as well.</p>

Schoen of ~200 people at the Occupy Wallstreet encampment in Zuccotti Park, October 10th & 11th, 2011. <a href="/storage/OccupyPDXdata/SchoenOccupyWallStreetPoll.pdf" target="_blank">A summary of that report can be found here.</a>
