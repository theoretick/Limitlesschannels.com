##Notes##

I miss my Vibram Five Fingers for their fantastic versatility and comfort but after significant wear-age they can really smell pretty terribly and without consistent washing can be a problem.  After my first batch wore through completely I regretfully gave them up.

Still working on getting rid of my my vinyl collection but both it and the record player are going to my brother, so I'll have to hold on to them for now lacking any sufficient place to store them.

Regarding storage, I am never satisfied with bags and am constantly looking for a new EDC bag.  I've used backpacks, hiking packs, climber bags, messenger/book bags, biker messenger bags, and just about everything else. I have ended up with (for me the most surprising when making this list) a rather large number of handbags.  I'm working on pairing that down now but my rapidity changing bags after a couple months has made me hesitant to just up and buy one of the BIFL bags such as a <a href="https://www.goruck.com/" target="_blank">Goruck</a> or some such.
