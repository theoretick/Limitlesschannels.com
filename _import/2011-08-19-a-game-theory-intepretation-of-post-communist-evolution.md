<p>From the<em> Journal of Economic Issues</em> <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://mesharpe.metapress.com/index/F81000Q1K5L277KQ.pdf&amp;pli=1" target="_blank">a paper on analysis of the post-soviet union collapse and evolution</a> through the lense of Game theory. &nbsp;I've only scanned this so far but good stuff. &nbsp;The piece is also pretty straightforward for those not versed in the subject, as well.</p>
