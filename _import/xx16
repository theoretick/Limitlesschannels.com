<p>I've always admired good long-form journalism even when I haven't had the patience to read through some pieces. &nbsp;Ages ago I found a list of the <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.kk.org/cooltools/the-best-magazi.php" target="_blank">25 Greatest Magazine Articles Ever Written</a> with some simply fantastic pieces by the likes of Neil Stephenson, David Foster Wallace, Michael Lewis, and Hunter S. Thompson. &nbsp;It took me a bit too long but I finally put in some annoying processing work to pull each and format into a single MOBI file for delightful kindle reading. &nbsp;Between <a href="http://www.instapaper.com" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> and the Chrome extension <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fipkfnchcgalnafehpglfbommidgmalan&amp;ei=ibKITpixN8bliALQvui6DA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPJRlCEK8doSI7O-6EnSouxenQ1w" target="_blank">Send To Kindle</a>, it would fairly straightforward. &nbsp;Should convert pretty well for those without a kindle, as well.</p>
