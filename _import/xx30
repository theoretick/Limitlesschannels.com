<p>Some awesome work on circadian rhythms of cloistered monks in France. &nbsp;Originally started to measure sleep patterns of their biphasic sleep (interrupted by a couple hours of prayer) the researchers started studying the effects of such sleep patterns (or maybe the cloistering... although there was a control I couldn't tell which of these the control was used for). &nbsp;Key interesting result: even after decades, the monks bodies had not adjusted to the awkward sleep cycle. &nbsp;Polyphasic aint for everyone.</p>
