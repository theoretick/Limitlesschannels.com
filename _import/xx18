BODY:
<p>Fernando Pessoa's beautiful poem "Autopsicografia" has been translated over 13 times. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.disquiet.com/thirteen.html" target="_blank">Disquiet.com has managed to gather up all the different translations</a> and place them together, letting you see exactly how translation can both create and destroy in the infinitismal variability into different tongues.</p>
<p>Sample opening line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O poeta &eacute; um fingidor. (Original)</p>
<p>The poet is a feigner.</p>
<p>Poets feign and conceal</p>
<p>The poet is a faker</p>
<p>The poet is a pretender</p>
