<p>LiveScience discusses the rise of the last few decades among the apocalypse-minded and <a href="http://www.livescience.com/14179-doomsday-psychology-21-judgment-day-apocalypse.html" target="_blank">what draws people to embrace the end</a>. &nbsp;My only real issue with the article is its explanation of the trend, hinging on the believe that there is something incredibly wrong with society, prompting an exceptancy that it will end. &nbsp;I wouldn't say it is something wrong so much as an understanding of the instability of our nearly vertical development trend in recent years. &nbsp;Change is scary, but not evil.</p>
