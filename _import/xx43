BODY:
<p>While reading Metafilter I stumbled on a new language learning system developed by&nbsp;Idahosa Ness called the Mimic Method. &nbsp;In the perpetual attempt to perfect pronunciation and accent acquisition, this method focuses on mimicry to achieve accurate pronunciation and reproduction. &nbsp;It is actually not far off from the method children use during language acquisition (see fixed forms and derived forms in child speech). &nbsp;<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.mimicmethod.com/about.html" target="_blank">It's in beta right now, but feel free to sign up</a>. &nbsp;Once I get in I'll report back with some tidbits and first impressions.</p>
