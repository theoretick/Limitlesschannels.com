<p>via <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/10/google_translate_will_google_s_computers_understand_languages_be.html" target="_blank">Slate</a>. &nbsp;Better article than I expected, but I generally like Slate's writing well enough. &nbsp;Some thoughts:</p>
<p>The ideas of these "newer methods of statistical analysis" the article mentions aren't really the case. &nbsp;I have personally discussed such work with one of the people working on DARPA's (then ARPA's) translation work as early as 1971. &nbsp;Google didn't pioneer this but the beauty of Google is and has always been the sheer mountain of capital they can throw at an issue that appears to have next to no real utility in their business model.</p>
<p>While for many it may seem obvious we are really just statistical engines and pattern recognition is the path to language, there is a reason that rule-based theory has gotten as far as it has. &nbsp;The robustness of Chomsky's generative linguistics (the mechanism) and his theory of universal grammar (the idea) has been tested for many years and still holds shockingly well today. &nbsp;Even if we are analytical engines we may have somehow still found a ruleset that matches every language presented. &nbsp;Or maybe we just found a limitation in human ingenuity instead where we simply can't move past patterning our speech in a consistent manner.</p>
<p>I rather like the <span>Wittgenstein quote included in the article, as well: "Don&rsquo;t ask for the meaning, ask for the use."</span></p>
