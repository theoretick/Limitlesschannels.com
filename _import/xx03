My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/191769677">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Orwell's writing is solid and he tells a fascinating story on a piece of history seldom covered.  While there can be no such thing as unbaised writing in such a emotional context, he seems to remain quite neutral yet comes across as both passionate and objective.  The strength of the writing is in Orwell's straightforward storytelling where he retains the journalist style to document what he might term only the essentials leading to elevation of each word as more than just passing description but the purest character-defining attributes.
