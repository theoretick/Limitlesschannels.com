<p>A bit off my usual posting path but having heard about this recently from Kevin Rose and Tim Ferriss' Random Show, I have been both incredibly curious and skeptical about the idea of oral supplementation for sun protection. &nbsp;From what I can tell with the research the antioxidants, true to their namesake, help protect the skin from the oxidation process, but that doesn't necessarily mean burn protection. &nbsp;Just noticed a post over on Inhuman Experiment where the topic is tackled a bit more in-depth. <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://inhumanexperiment.blogspot.com/2011/09/topical-vs-oral-antioxidants-for-sun.html" target="_blank">Topic versus Oral Antioxidants for Sun Protection - Which is Better?</a></p>
