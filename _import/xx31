BODY:
<blockquote>
<p>In the report &ldquo;Trends in Machine Translation,&rdquo; Common Sense Advisory explains the need for MT, discusses the major trends pushing it to be integrated into many more applications, and outlines the impact on organizations that should be employing machine translation.<br /><br />&rdquo;Machine translation was long characterized as a complex, expensive technology requiring a lot of computing horsepower. In 1956, if you wanted MT, you had to go to the United States Navy or to the KGB to get it. Today, the options for using MT ranged from desktop to in-house server to free online access,&rdquo; explains DePalma ... "By adding MT to their content mix, they&rsquo;ll lower the language barrier and open their companies to more global buyers.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;Trends in Machine Translation&rdquo; outlines five megatrends affecting machine translation: 1) the burgeoning acceptance of machine translation; 2) the demystification around the concept and practice of MT; 3) the enterprise-enabling of the technology; 4) the development of an ecosystem around machine translation; and 5) its changing business model and economics.</p>
<p><span>Adds DePalma, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for everyone to take a serious look at how machine translation fits into their content strategy for international markets.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what is said in this release on the report is just flat-out wrong, such as "<span><em>For post-edited MT, quality is already equivalent to human translation in many cases.</em></span>" &nbsp;I am in no way a conservative humanist in the "machines can never equal us" silly way, but I pay a lot of attention to this research and today's techniques and that isn't correct. &nbsp;Still, it is a topic that is more and more relevant and will continue to move forward whether or not it actually works apparently, so we better get cracking on a more correct (efficiency has reached a fine point, but we need clarity and correctness now) method.</p>

<p>Translation is not only about producing an accurate piece, it is also about the cultural aspect. Machine translations will hopefully never replace translations made by humans. Translation is a high skill. Translators need to be able to decode the source text and to produce a translation that reads naturally in the target language in order to convey the meaning properly. A professional translation company</a> can provide these services.</p>
