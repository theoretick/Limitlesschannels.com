Clarke</a><br /> My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/224710205">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br /> In yet another foray into scifi classics, I decided to pick up Rendevous with Rama.  While enjoyable, I am not sure what makes this book a "classic" or even considered a good book for that matter.  There is a large amount of nontraditional plot choices that come off as rather anticlimactic rather than creatively enigmatic.  While enamored out of the gate with the originality and time constraints provided by the plot, the entire second half of the book seems to go by with little to no development, just a bit more mystery and even less conflict.  In terms of said conflict, that bit amounts to a puzzling zero.  Every mission is carried out more-or-less smoothly, each crew member surviving, and any pseudo-conflict that arises (such as the missile) is quickly and efficiently dealt with.  Apparently everyone is just really competent.  When I discussed this with others many brought up ideas like how man chooses to attack the ship, but each encounter is so mildly addressed that it made me think it to be either a sidenote or some half-baked critique of Clarke's on humanity. <br /> <br />Arthur C. Clarke's writing is as always fantastic, the clear-cut style guides the reader along and makes each reading a relaxing and easy experience.  The scenery is clearly presented, with each reader having a strong geometric understanding of the ship's scope, and the characters are all likeable. <br /> <br />I tend to dislike blatantly cryptic endings.  It is one thing for mystery to be present at all (and for any accurate portrayal of an advanced civilization I would say it has to be) but the lack of conflict, the anticlimactic ending, and the frictionless narrative seems to hurt my overall takeaway from the tale.  Perhaps Arthur C. Clarke merely wanted the verse and wrote Rama for sequels.  So far that's the best I've come up with, but until then, I'll read go read Childhood's End. <br /><br /> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/5914093-lucas">View all my reviews</a></p>
