<p class="blockquote">NOTE: Work in Progress - Last updated 31oct2012</p>

On rare occasions over the past few years I have smoked cigarettes.  Usually at a bar or another party environment, wheather it is a result of those around me or some weird form of boredom, I have often found it a fascinating habit. My fascination lies in nicotines colorful and fascinating resume including its status with such a high degree of social acceptability, its links to <a href="http://www.neurobrainstorm.com/2012/10/why-tobacco-is-still-legal-side-effect.html" target="_blank">hormone production and DHT</a>, its effects <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/85508.php" target="_blank">as a pain-killer</a>, and even the seemingly contradictory evidence of its effects as both a stimulant and a depressant (see below) are fascinating. 

Unfortunately, cigarettes are messy and quite problematic.  I was curious about what exactly nicotine can do and the easiest way to control for the bevy of factors tied to cigarettes (social conditions, weather, countless side-effects, inconsistency of dosage) I decided to try out some nicotine patches.

##Background##

There has been <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080808123144.htm" target="_blank">some previous research</a> however that links nicotine's addictiveness to a specific genetic signature.  One such study showed that this gene may be responsible for the pleasure smokers get from their first cigarette and be directly responsible for the path of lifelong smoking all the way to lung cancer. 

In terms of published research all I've managed to find so far on depression has been <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2446482/" target="_blank">one case study</a> of a 48yo man with adult ADHD who used nicotine as a successful treatment for depression and anxiety. I'm curious whether or not that man had the aforementioned genetic marker, but there was no mention in the paper.  Other various reports online include such sites as drug-forums.com and erowid.
Cigarettes are problematic, the uneven dosage can be equally problematic both from the brand variations as well as inconsistencies with such basic habits as, say, frequency of "pulls" when inhaling.  
<a href="http://www.erowid.org/plants/tobacco/tobacco_nic.shtml" target="_blank">Here's a chart from a 1994 FTC study</a> about nicotine and tar content of the top domestic cigarette brands.

<strong>In terms of long term effects of the study, it appears to be quite safe in terms of addiction and long term harmful effects:</strong>

Regarding diabetes, the interactions between nicotine and glucose metabolism have been discussed previously with one study citing greater nicotine sensitivity **only** in people predisposed. Nicotine absorption <a href="http://examine.com/supplements/Nicotine/#summary6">"resulted in nonsignificant trends for increased insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels."</a>  As noted with that link, nicotine can affect healthy and diabetic people differently, but has no statistically significant results for healthy individuals.  For sake of argument I found <a href="http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/94/5/878.full" target="_blank">a more "human" study of nicotine gum leading to higher insulin resistance</a>, but don't find n=40 to be particularly compelling, though, perhaps more than rats.

Regarding addiction, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177026" target="_blank">it does not appear that the addictive properties involved in cigarettes or smoking are directly an effect of nicotine itself</a>. In other words, it is not the nicotine that is necessarily addictive.  I'll post my thoughts on any "withdrawal" when the week is completed.


##Setup##

The standard patch kits come in a 3-week supply: first week with the strongest dose and incrementing down to nicotine free on the fourth week.  Since I am not a standard smoker I decided to buy the second week transition system of 14mg transdermal patches (specifically CVS brand Habitrol patches).  Apparently the 3-week cycle was rebranded for this kit as a 3-step cycle and mine included a total of 14 patches, for a full two week dosage.  As stated on the box:


<p class="blockquote"> "if you smoke 10 or less cigarettes per day: start with step 2"</p>

I'll make a note however that this is definitely not the cheapest way to accessibly get nicotine, having paid $15 for the pack compared to a $6 pack of cigarettes, it was at least the greatest volume.  A standard cigarette will provide 1 to 1.5mg of nicotine each.  As stated above, smoking 10 cigarettes a day (the supposed equivalent of one patch) <strong>will net you 4mg LESS nicotine than the equivalent inhalant delivery.</strong>  If nothing less, I prefer the transdermal to the inhalatory (or enteral for that matter) method.

##Log##

<p class="blockquote">Note: I regularly drink coffee and alcohol, but to maintain my current routine I didn't feel it wise or necessary to subsist from either for the duration of my study.</p>

###Day One:###
     
13:13 - Patched in this morning at 10am and have had an excellent mild alertness for the past few hours.  Didn't feel the need for coffee this morning but since I can be a puppet to habit I ended up getting some anyway.  That may be a bit much and I'll probably hold off on the caffeine tomorrow.  Haven't eaten yet. I was worried about reports of nausea from the patch as noted in the above "pain management" link.

18:45 - Went to work and worked for 5 hours.  Was quite productive and managed to stay fairly focused and upbeat.  My current project involves crime victim issues and can involve spending significant periods of time reading through crime case reports leading, something that for most of this project has been an emotionally draining activity.  I have managed to stay largely upbeat today in spite of reading through some particularly bad cases.  I'm curious if I'm getting a mood boost with the patch but its far too early to tell.  Being more productive tends to boost my mood anyway.

###Day Two:###

13:41 - Woke up far too late today (If you want to see how late check on my other project LINK).  Got into work and worked for a few hours.  First hour of the patch gave me the same tingling/itching behavior as I experienced yesterday but fairly quickly subsided.  No coffee this morning and feeling plenty awake and alert.  General awareness with a slight haziness from sleep, so there isn't the full relief such as with Adrafinil/Modafinil or other eugregorics.

18:37 - still alert, still productive, focused, and aware.  I finally ate a meal and had a small cup of coffee to keep any caffeine withdrawal off.  After this I think I need to take a caffeine sabbatical.

21:39 - Feeling fine, had a beer and haven't noticed any direct conflict.  still maintaining my current energy level and focus throughout the day and see not obvious interactions.
