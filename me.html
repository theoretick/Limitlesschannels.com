        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>I do stuff and things.</p>
        <p>For now this site is really just a repository for my own link storage, random thoughts, and attempt to build up a more concrete online presence/por
tfolio.  Topics will drift and be both spaced and frequent.</p>
	<p>This is not a blog. Just about every page will be in perpetual development, so you may find broken things, incomplete things, and meanderings. True understanding requires constant revision, and so will these topics.</p>
