<p><em>"first off. it doesn't reflect my daily life. Most of what happens hour by hour is quiet and still. We sit most of the time"</em>  ~ Dhalgren, p.94</p>

<p>I do stuff and things.</p>

<p>This is not a blog. Just about every page will be under constant development, so you may find broken things, incomplete things, and meanderings. True understanding requires constant revision, so hopefully these pages will as well.</p>

<p>For now this site is largely a repository for my own link storage, random thoughts, and attempt to build up a more concrete online presence/portfolio.  Topics will drift and be both spaced and frequent. Maybe for now I'll coin the phrase 'asymmetric blogging.'</p>

<p>You can feel free to contact me a bit more securely with <a href="http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFDF9A65FF1672B09">PGP.</a></p>
